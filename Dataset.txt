5/29/22, 6:42 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): #BREAKING: ADELABU, OTHERS DUMP OYO APC

BREAKING: Oyo 2023: Adelabu dumps APC 
Published on May 29, 2022By Musliudeen Adebayo

Former Deputy Governor (Operations) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Adebayo Adelabu, has dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC).

Adelabu made this announcement on Sunday.

DAILY POST recalls that Adelabu was the gubernatorial candidate of APC in 2019.

Our correspondent recalls that Adelabu was one of the gubernatorial aspirants who contested the APC primary election on Friday.

Adelabu has, however, said that he has dumped the APC.

The former CBN Deputy Governor, who did not disclose the party where he would join ahead of 2023, said that the APC has been hijacked in the state.

Adelabu, who spoke during an emergency with his followers in Ibadan, said that he will realise his ambition in another political party.

At the meeting where the movement from APC to another yet-to-be announced party was considered, were Senator Ademola Adeseun, former Oyo South senatorial aspirant, Dr. Olusola Ayandele, former APC deputy Chairman, Alhaji Isiaka Alimi, Chief Goke Oyetunji, Chief Kunle Sanda, former Chairman of Atisbo Local government, Mr. Jacob Ogunmola, former ALGON Chairman, Ayodeji Abass-Aleshinloye and Mr. Wasiu Ajimobi, a younger brother to immediate past governor, Abiola Ajimobi.

Adelabu said that he is consulting with his followers from the 33 local government areas of the state to know the best political party to realise his ambition in 2023.

He said that he will announce his next political party in the next 48 hours after a meeting with leaders of his group.

Adelabu said, “Since my followers have asked me to leave APC, we have left the APC.

“We will sit down with our leaders to decide on the political party to join. We will come back to APC after winning the gubernatorial election, because we are progressives.

“It worked during the time of late Abiola Ajimobi, he left AC and went to ANPP and later came back to ACN.

“Just give us 48 hours to get back to you to announce the next political party to join.”

5/29/22, 6:56 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): 3rd force will only pass a message. 

Like Ladoja did under Accord party then.
5/29/22, 6:57 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Seyi won cos (in the order of importance and how it worked)

1. People were tired of Ajimobi 
2. He contested under PDP
3. Because some bigwigs supported him
5/29/22, 6:58 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Third force ft win some assembly seats. We saw it during Accord Party of Ladoja era

5/29/22, 8:20 PM - +234 703 446 8168: No, he wanted to go during AJ’s 2011 contest but BAT & co preferred AJ cos of his near lost to AKALA in 2007 (name was there already).

SOLAN felt Oyo o n sin eeyan le meji, so he wanted AJ to leave after first time and BAT and co claimed they can’t leave a performing governor out, hence AJ’s automatic return. SOLAN was offered the senate again but said NO and thus SOJI AKANBI’s chance!

SOLAN vex and left APC for LADOJA’s accord hoping to be the guber candidate but alas BABA LADOJA chose to contest as governor by himself and he had to settle for that same SENATE and lost to SOJI AKANBI!

He came back to APC and then began to jostle for the guber again and the rest is history for SOLAGBADE LANLEHIN.

#My Legal Team Will Reach Out To Shina Peller Over Defamation of My Character#

My attention has been drawn to some trending videos where Hon. Shina Abiola Peller accused me of sending hired assassins to kill him.

I am not an assassin and does not operate a death squad, therefore I could not have sent hired killers after Shina Peller or anyone.

It is highly condemnable for Hon. Shina Peller to publicly allege that I sent hired killers after him without stating a reason why I should want to do so.

I want to set the record straight that I do not have any anointed aspirant for the 2023 APC Oyo North senatorial district seat but I'll respect the decisions of the majority party members (delegates) in the district.

Hon. Shina Peller's very serious allegation against my person is unacceptable and must be verified by the security agencies.

It is saddening that Governor Seyi Makinde is using Shina Peller to attempt a smear campaign on me and destabilize Oyo APC ahead of the 2023 elections.

The cordial relationship between Governor  Makinde of PDP and Shina Peller of APC is  public knowledge. It is an open fact that Shina Peller has been publicly and privately hobnobbing with Governor Makinde since May 2019. This is an APC lawmaker that does not only talk down his political party but also recklessly attend PDP functions within and outside Oyo State.

Based on intelligence report at my disposal, Shina Peller's senatorial aspiration on the platform of APC is just a smokescreen to destabilise Oyo APC and demarket me as the governorship candidate of our great party. He is acting a script written by PDP/Makinde.

It is very unfair that Shina Peller is being used to malign me in order to score cheap political points. He is engaging in a campaign of calumny just because he wants to deputise Governor Makinde in the 2023 elections.

While I am urging the public to disregard the false allegation, I urge the law enforcement agencies to immediately investigate the serious allegation against my person with a view to letting the world know what transpired between him and the people he claimed to have personally arrested. Nigerians deserve to know the truth!

I have zero tolerance for libel and slander. Therefore, I have instructed my legal team to take up the defamation of my character by Hon. Shina Peller.

5/29/22, 10:43 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Abacha's son won Kano PDP Guber Primaries.

Elrufai's son won APC Kaduna North Federal Constituency.

Ajimobi's son won APC Ticket to contest Oyo Assembly Seat.

Ibori's daughter won PDP Okpe/Sapele/Uvwie Federal Constituency of Delta State.

Ganduje's son won APC primary election for House of Representatives Dawakin Tofa, Rimin Gado and Tofa.

Okowa's daughter won PDP House of Assembly Primaries.

Akala's son won APC primaries for Ogbomoso Federal Constituency.

Fayose's son won PDP Ekiti Central Federal Constituency .

Yarima's son also won....

The circle continues.

They all deliberately kept ASUU on strike in order to keep the circle continue easily for their children.

A heart has been shattered
Too much a dare😑

She is picking up this piece that you have scattered
She re-read the texts,remembering what they used to be🗒️
Her eyes begins to fill with tears🥺
She was his nothing
He has already moved on
He doesn't realize how much he  hurt her😟
She tried to cope,but she just can't😔

Everything is just too much 
She grabs her razor and goes into the bath tub🛁
She gets in with her razor in her hand📌
She cuts her wrists,slits her veins🔴
She is getting dizzy and lightheaded😩
She remembered him.
Yes. The good memories. Steamy moments. Adorable smiles😑
She wants to die and forget it's over😵

With a loud shout,she screams "I'm the one he wants"😱
The  only *ota piapia in my bottle*  has poured away


She moves out of the bathtub fustrated
She grabs a dress,wears it quickly and grab her keys🗝️
She drives up north where the ocean is located🌅

She stands, watching the ocean roaring
Each tides beating against one another
She has only one thought in her mind.To end it all☄️

She wants her suffering to end
She gave too much for love
She minutes her prayer and jumps into the water
Too much for love💔

5/30/22, 12:32 PM - +234 903 224 4825: I never have a defeatist mindset on some issues. 

I have read permutations on what the victory of Atiku means for APC. I have read ”only BAT can defeat Atiku” “only Osinbajo can defeat Atiku” ”only Lagbaja, only Tamedun” 

First, everyone has a right to their projections. Projections and permutations are only based on sight, facts available and insight. You can only speak from what you know and as far as you can see. 

In 1978, NPN had a primary. Adamu Ciroma was the projected winner. He was popular and had more experience. Shagari won the primaries and went on to win the elections. He did not win because he was from the North. He won because NPN had a more national spread.  We can debate the 12:2/3.

At the AD primaries for Presidential candidate,Bola Ige was going to win based on projections. He was the more mature politician. He was better known. Falae was an outsider. Falae won. He lost to Obasanjo because PDP had a more national spread. AD was a regional party. Regional parties can’t win the Presidency.

Yaradua a lesser known candidate defeated Buhari because PDP had a better structure and spread. Buhari claimed he was rigged out.

GEJ defeated a host of candidates in his first elections despite being  from a minority tribe. He had resources and the party worked for him.

Buhari would never have emerged president had the PDP not been factionalized. The new APC had more cohesion and the perception of the dismal performance of GEJ. There was also a tacit agreement that power should return to the North.

Atiku is a formidable candidate. No one zone or two can make anyone the President. If that were possible, Buhari would not have needed mergers of NPDP, ANPP and ACN with his CPC to win.

It’s not about Atiku being from the North. 

APC has a commanding national spread. Has more governors. More NASS members and has more resources. All APC has to do is to have a free and fair primary where the whoever wins is perceived to be from a free and fair process. It would also help that the respect for zoning is followed through. 

It is then the party’s elections to lose if it can manage fallouts from the process. 

SDP delivered an Abiola. The party made it happen. He won only one NW state. Kano. Yet he won the elections. 

Nigeria is polarised. Yes. If you saw the PDP primaries, neither Atiku nor Wike’s vote was from a zone. It has never happened that the North or South vote one. Never will happen.

Let’s take away our defeatist mindset and armchair analysis. The reality on the ground is not always what we sit down and write. Elections are not predictable in many instances.

As you have seen at the primary level, many trees have been uprooted by lesser known elements. 

It’s okay to pooh pooh this!

5/30/22, 2:26 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): APC Oyo North Senatorial Primaries, Assassination attempt on my life: True story of what transpired

There have been calls from loved ones, supporters, close associates and family about the controversy surrounding the All Progressives Congress (APC) Oyo North Senatorial Primaries which was scheduled to hold on Saturday 28th May 2022 at the Iseyin District Grammar School (IDGS), Iseyin as well as assassination attempt on my life.

This statement will therefore state the true picture of what actually transpired. The APC primaries ought to have been held on Saturday peacefully and transparently, but couldn’t hold due to selfish interest of some bad elements within the party who are determined to impose a candidate on all.

To set the record straight, there are five aspirants contesting for the APC Oyo North Senatorial ticket in the forthcoming 2023 general election, and they are my humble self, Honourable Shina Peller, the incumbent occupier of the seat, Senator Fatai Buhari, who is determined to return to the Senate for the third term by whatever means, Honourable Saheed Alaran, Chief Ogunbode and Mrs. Adeola Adeboyin.

At IDGS, the supposed venue for the primaries, the delegates and all aspirants including myself had arrived since 10am, except Senator Fatai Buhari who was nowhere to be found, as well as the party officials who were supposed to conduct the primaries.

We were all there waiting for several hours with no sight of Senator Buhari and party officials until when we got an information that secret accreditation of delegates was ongoing at Sharapy Hotel, Odo-Omu area, Iseyin-Oyo Road, Iseyin. We moved to the hotel and we saw that truly a lot of buses were parked around with so many people engaging in illegal accreditation. When they saw us, they started running away.

Whilst we were at the hotel, we got another information that they had moved to the residence of the former Iseyin Local Government Chairman, Engineer Abolade and that some aggrieved people were already on their way to his house to disrupt their illegal process. To avoid any violence, myself, other three aspirants had to move to the place so that we could control the situation. When we got there, we discovered that truly kangaroo primaries was already ongoing with some unaccredited delegates with result sheets and membership registration slips that have no passports.

This kangaroo primaries was being conducted with close supervision of the former Oyo State Commissioner for Works and Transport, Alhaji Wasiu Dauda Azuzu and Senator Fatai Buhari. When they realized that there was no way they could continue with their secret voting, we were invited to a meeting at premier hotel to resolve the issue. We were surprised to be informed that they decided to postpone the primaries until the following day and unconstitutionally moved the venue from Iseyin to Saki to enable them manipulate the process and impose Senator Buhari on us all.

This was the true picture of what transpired on Saturday, and as God would have it, gentlemen of the press were on ground at the IDGS; they witnessed and reported everything. Arise TV, AIT, Punch, Nation, Thisday, Tribune, Sun, Independent newspapers, Radio Nigeria, Oke Ogun FM and other notable media outlets were on ground and as evident in their reports, they spoke to all other four aspirants right there at the venue except Senator Fatai Buhari who was somewhere else with other bad elements in the party trying to manipulate the primaries. Also, the police, Civil Defense Corps, INEC officers and observers were on ground and they can easily be contacted to verify our claim. Any other writeup or report contradicting this should be regarded as lies and you can as well query the source of such reports.

So having failed in their attempt to manipulate the primaries on Saturday, they unconstitutionally moved it to Saki on Sunday, and they were able to succeed in carrying out their kangaroo primaries with fake delegates’ list under the protection of hoodlums who had been massively mobilized to the venue.

Regarding the report on the assassination attempt on my life, this was true. I was at Premier Hotel in Ibadan for the meeting with other APC Oyo North Senatorial aspirants who were not satisfied with what happened in Iseyin on Saturday. After the meeting, I left Premier Hotel for Oke Ogun in my convoy. 

However, a few minutes after we had left, I got an intel that six vehicles (Four cars, and two buses) loaded with thugs and ammunitions were on my trail to take my life. They gave the description of the vehicles, and I passed the information to my security details. 

Whilst still on our way, we got another information that the vehicles were parked about one kilometer away from my house in Iseyin. When we got to the spot, we actually noticed that the vehicles in question matched the same description we had been given earlier and had campaign stickers and face caps of Senator Teslim Folarin. My security details then decided to disarm and arrest them.

My life is seriously being threatened just because I am trying to protect the interest of my dear people from the Oke Ogun region. I am using this opportunity to call on President Muhammadu Buhari, relevant stakeholders and security agencies to call Senator Teslim Folarin and his evil machinery to order, as people will hold him accountable if anything happened to me, my family or my aides.

5/30/22, 4:45 PM - +234 906 762 1398: TEXT OF A PRESS CONFERENCE ADDRESSED BY HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY AND NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ASPIRANTS OF THE ALL PROGRESSIVES CONGRESS, APC, STATE OF OSUN, ON THE IMPUNITY, CHARADE, CONFUSION AND MANIPULATION OF THE STATE AND NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PRIMARIES BY GOVERNOR ADEGBOYEGA OYETOLA AND HIS COLLABORATORS IN THE STATE OF OSUN

A RAPE OF DEMOCRACY BY GOVERNOR GBOYEGA OYETOLA AND HIS COLLABORATORS

This Press Conference is jointly addressed by 12 aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State of Osun, who belong to The Osun Progressives (TOP) caucus of the party. We welcome our dear members of the fourth estate of the realm to this press conference. We acknowledge the authentic leadership of the progressive’s political platform in Osun as constituted by those here now and numerous others in absence.

On behalf of other aspirants to the State House of Assembly and National Assembly positions, and the leadership of the authentic progressive’s platform, we wish to bring to the fore, indeed the attention of the whole world, the charade and sham that Governor Adegboyega Oyetola and his ilk called primary elections in the state. An autocratic and dictatorial regime couldn't do worse in dragging democracy on the floor than what Governor Oyetola and his collaborators have done on the House of Assembly and National Assembly Primaries of our party. The late dark goggle general didn’t bring as much odium to democracy as Governor Oyetola.

We the undersigned are members of the All Progressives Congress in the State of Osun and are aspirants who obtained Expression of Interest and Nomination forms to contest for House of Assembly and House of Representatives in our various state constituencies and federal constituencies in the state. 

In line with the available sketchy guidelines of the party and short notice available to us following our tenacious search for information, we participated in the screening conducted by the party and we were cleared to take part in the primary elections. 

However, after the screening exercise, Governor Oyetola called a meeting of all the State House of Assembly and National Assembly aspirants to the Government House, Osogbo, where, among other anti-democratic statements uttered by the Governor, he stated that some aspirants are not loyal to him, (not necessarily to the party) and he would not allow them to emerge victorious in the primary elections.

It would be recalled that, the primary elections for the state House of Assembly was slated for Thursday 26th May, 2022.  To our dismay and chagrin, till the day of that primary there was no communication at all about the modalities for the election. The committee saddled with the responsibilities of conducting the election was not known to anybody, especially we the aspirants in our tendency. We considered that act as a deliberate way of tactically excluding us from the race. Apart from the fact that we did not see any committee from the National Secretariat, NOBODY called to inform us about the modalities for the Election. However, around 1pm on Thursday, 26th of May, the day slated for the House of Assembly primary election, a letter surfaced from unknown source and largely shared on the social media, wherein a Direct Primary mode of Elections was supposedly adopted for Osun, Benue and Kebbi states. The letter which was dated 25th May, 2022 was purportedly signed by His Excellency, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, the National Chairman of our party, and the National Secretary.

Meanwhile, even before the letter surfaced online, we as popular aspirants in our various constituencies have mobilized the party members who are our supporters to the various collation centres in our constituencies, so that we might not be caught unawares. When the said letter from the National Secretariat surfaced online, we quickly sent messages round to all our supporters to stay put at the various ward collation centres for the primary election. Our people were there at the various collation centres and nothing was happening until around 5pm when some factional ward chairmen from the Governor's camp surfaced, claiming to be the Presiding Officer for the primary election. These chairmen did not come to the collation centres with any electoral materials like APC membership register, results sheets, e.t.c. They just asked the party members to raise up their membership cards, queue and without any proper accreditation, did the counting, wrote the results on a PIECE OF PAPER and left. Even with such fraudulent and reprehensible conduct, our supporters were more than those of our opponents and we had the highest number. In some wards, there was no counting of APC members at all. 

There and then, we went to various collation centres for the Local Government where the results for the local government ought to be collated. Nobody showed up at the Local Government Collation Centre till we left there around 8:30, 9pm and 10pm as the case may be.

The same scenario was repeated for the House of Representatives primary which took place on Friday 27th May, 2022 and up till this moment, there are no official results for both the State House of Assembly and National Assembly primary elections in Osun.

May we note that with the high level of impunity and manipulations involved in the process and shenanigans engaged to get rid of us, the joke has now turned on Governor Oyetola’s group, as all its aspirants in various constituencies are laying claims to victory and confirming it with concocted figures aimed to suite their fraud. It is unheard of, even a shameful experience, that four and three days after the primaries have been held, the Governor and his collaborators in the party are unable to declare winner in the contests. In practical terms, the reason espoused for the existence of our tendency, reformation of Osun APC, couldn't have been better brought to the fore than the present show of shame. It is obvious that the Osun APC is rudderless and lack needed discipline which can only exists where the leadership is forthright, upright and seasoned. 

Finally, the information at our disposal is that all the results sheets are currently in the custody of Governor Gboyega Oyetola and the results sheets are being filled with the names of the Governor’s cronies who never won the primary elections, hence the need for this conference.

Therefore, we call on His Excellency, the National Chairman of our party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu to use his good office to correct the current act of impunity and rape of democracy being displayed by Governor Gboyega Oyetola before it is too late.

Thank you all for listening attentively and we pray that you will auspiciously relay this important information to the general public and the particular audience it is meant for, to protect Nigeria's democratic development.

5/30/22, 6:10 PM - +234 903 939 4958: Again, Thugs Disrupt Ado/Odo-Ota Reps Primaries, Snatch Ballot Papers As Ojugbele Claims Victory

The heavy presence of security operatives from the police, Nigeria army, Amotekun, etc, could not prevent the gunmen to again, disrupted the rerun primary election of the All Progressives Congress, APC in the Ado-Odo Ota Federal Constituency.

The thugs who invaded the venue of the primary held at Alamuwa Grammar School, went for the ballot box and papers shortly before the election was concluded.

It was gathered that election had been concluded in 14 out of the 16  wards before the thugs invaded the hall and started shooting repeatedly.

The Chairman of the local government, Sherif Musa popularly called ‘Sam 20’ was alleged to have led the thugs into the hall after he had observed that a particular aspirant was winning the election.

Horizontimes reports that the main primaries which was earlier held on Friday ended in chaos as thugs also invaded the venue of the primaries and chased away delegates and other party faithful with repeated gunshot. (https://horizontimesng.com/gunshots-as-violence-disrupts-ado-odoota-apc-reps-primary/).

Speaking with our correspondent, Hon Yomi Olojeloju Yommaz , who was the agent of one of the aspirants and the member representing Ado-Odo/Ota Federal Constituency at the national assembly hinted that the trouble started when the local government Chairman requested that all agents should go out of the hall and return when the votes are to be counted.

“He requested the police officers to ask us to go out and that we should come into the hall after the voting exercise, I disagreed with him and we insisted in witnessing the election, all the six agents present were later allowed to wait.

“We started voting around 3pm and was left with two wards out of the 16 wards, somebody just went outside to tell them that Hon. Jimoh Olusola Ojugbele  is winning, they immediately organized themselves and they moved in and snatched the ballot box and destroyed the papers.

“They realized they have lost, they mobilized to the scene, cart away ballot box and papers. I can confirm to you that it was the local government Chairman who invited the thugs, led them in and disrupted the exercise, I was there live.

“He was there in the guise of being a local government chairman, he’s neither an agent or delegate, but he was monitoring the exercise and observed people weren’t voting for Akinosi.”

Another agent, Sakiru Tiamiu , who stood in for a former Chairman of the local government who is also an aspirant in the ongoing process,  Rahmon Rotimi , also told our Correspondent that he was ordered out of the voting center by security operatives.

He said, “We were told to go out of the hall and come back after the election is ready for counting, we insisted that wasn’t the best practice and all six out of seven agents were resolute on this.

“They asked me for the name of my aspirants and brought out a paper written in pen, but the name of my aspirant was not on the ballot and I was asked to stay aside in the hall.

“Before they started voting, the Council Chairman told the police officers and the electoral officers to chase all agents out, we again insisted that he was not supposed to be in the hall because he was neither a delegate nor agent. At the end of the day, we were allowed to stay.

“When the process was on, one Asade Wahab who was a House of Assembly aspirant also came into the voting all and asked me to go out, the police officers also came and asked me to go out.

“I was going out of the hall when some thugs approached me, I had to run back to the security officers who escorted me out of the place. But within the twinkle of an eye, the thugs invaded the hall and destroyed the voting materials while shooting repeatedly. That was when I was able to escape from the scene.”

When contacted, the local government Chairman denied involvement in the activities of the thugs, saying that he also escaped through the windows when the thugs struck.

“You can confirm from the police and DSS, I was also inside when the people came in, I had to run through the window, how can I lead the thugs? All those ones are fictitious allegations. I was inside making sure that things were going on well, we were all there when the boys came in.

“I couldn’t know who was leading the election, I was at a distance to the voting center, and I couldn’t see what people were writing not to talk of knowing who is leading. I do not want to mention names, I don’t want to throw allegations, they are the ones feeling jittery, they are the ones that started those mayhem, but for me, all of them are my candidate,” he said.

Effort to get Akinosi who was believed to be favoured by the Deputy Governor Naimot Salako-Oyedele who is from the same local government proved unsuccessful, as calls put across to his mobile phones did not deliver for several hours.

Meanwhile, Ojugbele, in a statement made available to HorizonTimes said the rerun was an exercise in futility becaus he had won the election since the Friday ballot.

“I brought Electricity (Eron) into Lagos as well as Telecomunication (Econet). I was part of those who fought the military (via NADECO) and institutionalized Democracy in Nigeria. I brought Governance closer to the people at Grassroots by creating Local Council's now copied by some states. To demonstrate my firm believe in Unity, I brought other tribes (Hausa, Igbo Yoruba, Delta, etc) into governance in Lagos. Singularly, I was responsible for preventing the creation of a "One-Party State; salvaging Nigeria’s democracy from dictatorial inclinations”

They killed him at 7pm, at Onipanu Lagos, he was fucking predictable, they knew he would  always remove all the magical charms on his body whenever he's praying Maghrib at 7pm in his house at Onipanu...
 *Prof Peller* paid the price of being predictable.

▪Early morning tea was his favourite, he loved tea like he loves his women, all they needed to do was... do the tea and give him to sip. *M K O Abiola* paid the price of being predictable.

▪They knew my father will always stand up to ease himself without carrying his cup of beer along while he is in party with his friends drinking.
He came back to the drink, to drink poison diluted with his beer in the cup.
My father *Mr Adesanya* paid the price of being predictable in 2009.

▪Apple was his favourite, just like Asian virgins, the General saw flawless virgins and forgot military intelligence, he ate the Apple and collapsed. *Sanny Abacha* the man.

▪ *Alhaja Ajagbe Iyaloja* Oworo market will always come out every 5am to perform ablutions instead of using her bathroom at times .
She was found lying lifeless on the floor killed by hired killers.
Another price  of being predictable.

▪He is a protocol type of a man. He usually tear his mail himself to read instead of his Chief Security Officer
He tore a letter bomb one day thinking it was the kind of mail he receives day to day as usual.
 *Dele Giwa* paid the price of being predictable.

*Being predictable is very professional but it always lead to nasty regrets, apply military intelligence to your common sense to survive.*

*If you have been taking a route to your office, please change it sometimes!*
If you always arrive by 9, you're dead mate, change it!  Do not let people know dat.... E go soon come, e go soon drive pass, na dis road e dey pass, na here e dey eat, na dis food e dey like, he must leave office or shop by 5pm.
He always lodge in this hotel when he comes to Abuja for meeting. na here e dey do faaji every Sunday. Hmmmmmm *O LEWU O!!!*

**BE A BIT UNPREDICTABLE* 

 I saw this and felt like sending it to you all as a reminder.

He is doing well at least

But do you know that an ordinary member of the aggrieved public can’t go in to his place and make their cases heard

You need to know someone who can amplify it for you

Also do you know he was suspended recently for assault( slapping someone publicly) and twice for that matter

5/31/22, 11:59 AM - +234 903 224 4825: The GATEKEEPERS Series (6).. Vice-President YEMI OSINBAJO, GCON. FRN.

It should not surprise you that as the Highest Ranking Individual in this contest, you will have the most number of questions and concerns.

We are not here to debate your qualifications, academic, professional or otherwise.

Unlike your fellow ASPIRANTS you have the Most Experience at the highest level of FEDERAL EXECUTIVE DECISION-MAKING. 

Even your Challengers admit from one side of their mouths that you are more than eminently qualified. Sometimes this sounds as admiration whilst trying to downplay your advantages over them.

YOUR CV remains impeccable HOWEVER.. The Gatekeepers have SERIOUS  CONCERNS bordering on...

1. With the possible fragmentation of the SW votes, issues of Loyalty and Servitude within, can the APC be assured of the vast number of Votes from the SW, a zone that has never historically given any one candidate more than 50% collectively?

What efforts, can you assure the Party, are being made to mend the potential wounds within the Region, likely to affect the outcome of the General Elections?

2. Do you bear GRUDGES? There is a palpable "fear" that IF you become President, there is likely to be a mood of vendetta against those who have persecuted and/or played a role in being hampered following your actions whilst serving as Acting President.

What assurances can you give a section of the Country that all that was a mere part and parcel of Leadership?.. Comes with the Territory?

3. There is a persistent notion, Real or Imagined, that yours would be a Government/Leadership driven by Religious Leanings within a Country fundamentally based on Secularity.

Again what assurances can you give us that, including your present day actions, this is a misguided and untrue notion?

4. IF we select you to go forward and represent us in the General Elections, you will have to confront a portion of the Electorate who have been dissatisfied with this present Administration within which you have served as Vice-President for 7 going on 8 years.

What do you have to say to such dissatisfied section of Nigerians?

What will be different with you as President?

5. We have tried very hard with all resources available to us, to find any Ugly and historical evidence of Corruption, Falsification of Documents, Poor Personal Behaviour, Habits or  Curious Personal Judgements on your part.

So to ask DIRECTLY, are there any hidden, as yet undiscovered, Bad or Poor Character items in your Cupboard which could be used against you?

It is important for us to have FULL DISCLOSURE before we reach the APC Special Convention in the coming days.

We have Options. And they may not necessarily fall into the category of Front-Runners but are on THE LIST. Though it is our PRIMARY BELIEF and Intention for the Presidency to go DUE SOUTH.

6. You can whisper to us Whom you may be considering as Running Mate to effect Balance and Fairness with you being a SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN in a Nation that constantly seeks Equity on numerous, Tribal, Religious and Sectional Grounds.

We promise not to tell anyone UNTIL such a time as you are privileged to do so.

Mr. Vice-President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, your time starts now.

#Goodmorning 
Ivor Ekpe II
5/31/22, 11:59 AM - +234 903 224 4825: The Answers to the Issues raised;


1. SOUTH WEST ZONE. His Region is under contention by the show of Aspirants emerging from the Zone.

He will make every effort to corral all that energy into a formidable block at the General Elections.

The SW like every other zone has vested interests in a United Nigeria and whilst individual preferences may differ, for now, Collective Interest will win at the end of the day.

2. GRUDGES.
The privilege of having served as Vice-President has exposed one to the dynamics and intrigues within a Presidency.

The President presides and determines overall what happens and what direction the country takes as the final decision-maker.

Be assured that there is no decision taken by a Vice-President without at least the knowledge of a President. 

It is PROTOCOL and 4he way the structure is.

A Vice-President serves at the pleasure of a President but also stands to face the dynamics and intrigues in the absence of a President.

I bear no grudges as any such adversarial actions, if real, come with the territory.

3. RELIGION and RELIGIOUS leanings.

It is very evident, for those who care to investigate rather than rely on hearsay or rumours, that the composition of the appointments within the Office of Vice-President reflects the true balance of our Religions, Gender and Age issues.

It must also be further mentioned, that those engaged within the Office of the Vice-President are so engaged as Staff of the President subsequently SECONDED to the Ofiice of the Vice-President. 

4. DISSATISFIED ELECTORATE.

This administration has worked hard in many areas to mend the faults in our systems especially our Institutions.

We have similarly focused on great improvements for the betterment of the larger population.

Despite such laudable efforts, there are areas we can and must improve upon as many problems persist.

However, these problems and issues did not suddenly arrive with this administration. Some have been long standing.

Nonetheless, No Government can be successful without the support of the people who must be similarly committed to a joint effort.

Nigeria is a vast, populous and diverse country with everyone having a vested interest or the other. All of whom seek to be and must be Accommodation.

My pledge is to continue these efforts at bridging the gaps in satisfaction wherever such may be required.

5. SKELETONS .. There are NO SKELETONS anywhere to be found, to the best of my knowledge, which may embarrass Nigerians and any Administration on my part... especially on a Global Stage.

6. RUNNING MATE.. 
My eventual choice of Running Mate shall be carefully thought out and bid to BALANCE the Peoples of Nigeria removing certain immediate "hurdles" to our Unity and Continuity.

That decision will be made at the appropriate time.
5/31/22, 11:59 AM - +234 810 206 9268: Yes I know

5/31/22, 3:21 PM - +234 903 224 4825: WE MUST SHOW POSITIVE QUALITIES OF APC AT OUR CONVENTION, PRESIDENT BUHARI CHARGES PROGRESSIVE GOVERNORS

President Muhammadu Buhari has charged Governors of the All Progressives Congress to ensure that the forthcoming convention to pick a presidential candidate reflects all the values and virtues of the party.

At a meeting Tuesday at State House, Abuja, the President told the 22 Governors and the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu:

“The processes for the 2023 General Elections have commenced in earnest and I note that the most successful political parties globally have always relied on their internal cohesion and a strong leadership brand to achieve bigger electoral fortunes. Our party, the APC, shall not be any different, more so as we are still implementing the blueprint for a more prosperous nation.

“As I begin the final year of my second term as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and leader of the party, I recognize the compelling need for me to provide stronger leadership to the party under this transition process and to ensure that it happens in an orderly manner.

“Such leadership is required so that the party remains strong and united. It is also needed to improve our electoral fortunes by ensuring that it retains power at the center, hold the great majority  in various legislative chambers and also gain additional number of states.
 

“In a few days, the party will be holding its Convention during which primaries would take place to pick the Presidential Flag Bearer for the 2023 General Elections. This is a very significant process and its outcome should prove to the world, the positive quality of the APC regarding democratic principles, culture as well as leadership.”

The President appealed to all the Governors “to allow our interests to converge, our focus to remain on the changing dynamics of our environment, the expectations of our citizens  and the global community. Our objective must be the victory of our party and our choice of candidate must be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence even before the elections.”

President Buhari assured that the consultation process will continue, to ensure that all aspirants and stakeholders would be brought on board right through to the convention, stressing that it would also ensure that any anxiety occasioned by different factors are effectively brought under control, “and that our party emerges stronger.”

Speaking on behalf of the States' helmsmen, Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, and Chairman of Progressive Governors Forum said the party must build on successes of its recent elective convention, and the primaries conducted so far, “ and come up with a candidate who will walk in the footsteps of patriotism and love for the country, which Mr President has shown.”

“We will support Mr President to have a very successful convention,” he pledged.

Atiku didn't consult delegates as others did because he had a strategy for winning.

So saying bello didn't consult stakeholders or delegate because he didn't rent hall, take pictures is something I'm still not understanding.

5/31/22, 5:07 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Saying someone who went to hire crowd and declare for President in Abuja will do consultation without media is even funnier than the thought of him winning the ticket
5/31/22, 5:07 PM - +234 817 014 8364: Yes he has been consulting since he lost the last elections.

My point is that he was not jes doing like BAT and PYO cuz no b today.

Bello too don de nurse ambition for long and he as also consulted. No b everyone go de rent hall and carry media like PYO and Bat
5/31/22, 5:07 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Yahaya Bello no go carry 3rd for that convention
5/31/22, 5:08 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Okay

5/31/22, 5:09 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): The purpose of that message isn’t about hired crowd 

Just asking you please make it make sense to me that someone who hired crowd will feel media involvement in consultation is not necessary.

5/31/22, 7:06 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Being the Three Years in Office Broadcast by His Excellency Seyi Makinde, on Tuesday, May 31, 2022

My Dear Good People of Oyo State,

When you gave us the mandate to serve, we made a promise to you, that we would engineer a modern Oyo State by building on four pillars: Education, Economy, Health and Security. As we mark our third year in office, we have another opportunity to share our scorecard with you so that you can judge how well we have kept that promise.

As we review the past year, we are thankful that our administration’s economic policies in the past three years are yielding the desired results. We have always said we believe in data, science and logic.

The data we had showed that our resources as a nation was dwindling. Oil prices had dropped and there was a need to focus on raising our Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). Back then, Oyo State was generating less than 1.7 billion naira a month. Our plan based on this data, was to focus on projects that would yield the revenue needed to reduce our infrastructure deficit.

At that time, the system was in decay. Our public schools had multiple cases of dilapidated buildings unfit for our children to learn. Our healthcare system was in shambles with primary and secondary healthcare facilities becoming mere consulting rooms.

Security was a big campaign issue. We promised reforms.

Little did we know that about 8 months later, the world would be dealing with a pandemic that would further exacerbate the economic downturn and throw off our timetable for economic stability. Yet, we were determined to keep all our promises, expectations were delayed but never denied.  

Looking back now to all we have been able to accomplish despite the huge challenges we faced, I can only say thank you to you, the good people of Oyo State for your patience and understanding all through this time. Thank you for trusting us to deliver on our promises.

We do know there is a lot more to be done. Worldwide, economies are struggling. Inflation rates in Nigeria remain on the rise and the spending power of Nigerians continues to fall. As a government, our role is to keep executing policies that will reduce the burden on our people.

This is why in the past year, we have remained focused on building an efficient road network, ensuring an interlinking of all zones to further enhance trade and commerce.

Where roads go, development follows.

We are already seeing the results. A recent mini survey on agribusiness in Oyo State since 2019 shows that by creating an enabling environment for the private sector to do business, we have attracted over 23 billion naira in agribusiness investments. Additionally, we have secured 125 million dollars in development partners blended finance for rural roads, agro logistics, market and industrial hubs. All of these contribute to providing direct and indirect jobs for our teeming population.

We are proud of projects such as the Fasola Agribusiness Industrial Hub which is about 80 percent complete and will be ready for commissioning by the end of the year. Investors in production, processing and livestock sub-sectors are already operating from the hub.

In the past year, we completed the first phase of the Lekan Salami Sports Complex, Adamasingba and put it into use. Our darling Shooting Stars, who in the past year also got promoted to the Nigeria Professional Football League, now have a befitting facility to play in. Also, the income generated by this facility has already doubled, with a projected revenue increase of 300% when the entire complex is completed.

More recently, we commissioned the Ojoo and Challenge Bus Terminals in Ibadan. Off peak, these terminals handle up to 10,000 passengers daily.

Of course, as promised, we have not increased taxes, rather, we have expanded our tax net to include persons who hitherto did not pay taxes.

The result of all these revenue generating activities is that we have been able to continue funding projects that the good people of Oyo State can benefit from. In the past year, we completed the construction of 8 model schools bringing the total number of model schools completed by our administration to 56 since we assumed office 3 years ago.

We have expanded the Start Them Early Program (STEP) to now include an additional 6 schools. We are seeing the results of 1,276 students being exposed to modern agricultural practices and choosing agribusiness right from secondary school.

We have gone a long way in fulfilling our promise of ensuring at least one standard Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) in each of the 351 wards of our state. Presently, we have upgraded nearly 200 PHCs and will now begin to equip them. We continued with our free health mission to the indigent and underserved. In the past year, we reached over half a million residents with medical and surgical interventions. In total, over one million, two hundred thousand residents of Oyo State have benefitted from the free health missions since it commenced in 2020.

We have provided over 280 kilometres of public lighting through the ‘Light up Oyo’ project. This has not only enhanced economic activities as markets remain open for longer, but it has also improved the security in the state. Not only that, we have provided lighting in off-grid areas. Communities such as Otefon in Atiba Local Government Area had electricity supply for the first time since their existence over 100 years ago. While work is ongoing to provide off grid electricity at Agbararu Community in Iwajowa Local Government Area, Ajia Community in Ona Ara Local Government Area and Arowomole Community in Ogbomoso South Local Government Area.

Crime rates are on the decline as we continue to equip all security agencies in Oyo State. Just last month, we handed over 100 operational vehicles to Oyo Amotekun. These vehicles have been deployed to all 33 local government areas of our state. We are also recruiting an additional 500 personnel into Oyo Amotekun. Yes, a crime-free society is not humanly possible, but we are working assiduously to ensure that the relative security we have in Oyo State is maintained. Today, our farmers in Ibarapa and Oke-Ogun Zones who had abandoned their farms due to security concerns are returning to the farms.

Our plan is to consolidate on the gains of the last three years in the one year we have left in our tenure.

In the past three years, we have been executing road projects that improve access and connectivity between the zones in the state through construction and reconstruction of roads such as the 65km Moniya-Ijaiye-Iseyin Road, the 76.7km Ogbomoso-Fapote-Iseyin Road, the 34.85km Oyo-Iseyin Road and the proposed reconstruction of the 48km Ido-Eruwa Road. It is now time to start moving inwards.

In the next year, we will be concentrating on the construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of our feeder roads. This will make inner-city travel even more stress free.

We will also continue to work with the private sector, especially those involved in agribusiness to expand our economy. With the flag-off of the Eruwa Agribusiness Industrial Hub next month, there will be even more opportunities to do agribusiness in Oyo State.

We have trained 4,050 youths in agribusiness under various programmes including the Youth Entrepreneurship in Agribusiness Project (YEAP). 98 of these youths have started their businesses and others along with them will be supported in diverse agribusiness enterprises in the coming weeks.

We will also be supporting our smallholder farmers. The rollout of another phase of the Oyo-CARES project will provide our farmers with inputs such as fertilizers, herbicides and seeds, and assets such as water pumps and sprayers.

We promised you omi tuntun. We will continue to provide omi tuntun.

God bless Oyo State.

God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

It was not only Lagos state, Katsina, Nassarawa, Ebonyi and Niger state.

The states are moving and nothing dey sup!

Oyo state is a case!
6/1/22, 4:29 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): This is the lie Tinubu and his herd followers always tell to the uninformed. 
And, it has been said that "a half-educated child is a lost child and a mis-educated child is a virus that is more deadly than ebola". 

But, we owe it a sacred duty and religious obligation to circulate knowledge in its truest form. At no point did the Federal Government withhold the FAAC allocation of Lagos State Government during the reign of Obasanjo as President or before. 

The only thing that was witnessed during those days was the seizure of the local government funds for three years and it shouldn't even be the business of the State government to rant if we were to be a serious democratic country. 
The State should have no business with the Local Government funds, but, it is what it is. 

Tinubu and his boys should stop selling falsehood and roll out facts.

The LG allocation was later released, YES!
6/1/22, 4:33 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): It was released of course
6/1/22, 4:33 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Okay!
6/1/22, 4:33 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Then the question we should be asking is; How did LASG managed the LG as at the time?

Before the recent constitution review…

• the states used to receive the allocations and fund the LGs - Remember Akala and his way of funding LGs?

After the constitution review…

• LG autonomy was just reiterated and made known publicly. Remember the issue GSM had with the democratically elected chairmen of AJ?

Egbeda/Ona-Ara Federal Constituency Contest: Withdrawal of Hon. Akinjide Kazeem Akinola Over Manipulation of Delegate List

Fellow compatriots, Party faithful, leaders of our great Party, All Progressives Congress (APC), my frabjous supporters and members of the press. It has become imperative that I, Hon. Akinjide Kazeem Akinola withdraw my desire to aspire for the Egbeda/Ona-Ara Federal Constituency seat come 2023 under the All Progressives Congress (APC). 

This decision painfully becomes necessary following the irregularities that have continued to trail the execution of the Constituency primaries that our great Party, All Progressives Congress (APC) has failed to organise. 

As a frontliner in the race for the seat of Egbeda/Ona-Ara Federal Constituency, we have come this far, showing and displaying commonsense politics with philosophical calmness. We expected that the APC as a progressive party would allow for level playing field for all aspirants but that was not to play out.

In the cause of events in the past few days, it was evident there were elements within the people saddled with the responsibility to conduct the primaries but who had ulterior motives and vested interests.

Contrary to Party faithful and delegates' expectations, the Party failed repeatedly to make use of the original delegate list from the National Secretariat of All Progressives Congress (APC). Rather, at the many attempts, the Party came up with doctored delegate list which was persistently resisted by our team.

In the light of the above shenanigans, I have therefore after due consultation with my leaders as well as my teeming supporters decided to withdraw from the race. I will be communicating my next action plan in the next few days to my supporters both at home in Nigeria and in the diaspora. 

Thank you.

Hon. Akinjide Kazeem Akinola.

6/1/22, 10:23 PM - +234 903 645 3146: Admins please give me your Attention because I have been observing something on this platform and it seems nobody is talking or everybody is doing eye service.
For me,I don't pretend, I say it the way it is but I am always careful not to insult anyone but I will definitely say the truth because for the fact that it has not gotten to you does not mean you won't talk about it and I owe nobody an apology because I need to say my mind
We all here are matured so we all need to know that today is 1st of June, 2022 and it is Wednesday

6/2/22, 4:43 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): CHANGE OF POLITICAL PARTY: Being a public statement on the movement of my membership from All Progressives Congress (APC) to ACCORD Party of Nigeria (ACCORD)

A time exists in the life of a sincere aspiring man of the public when events and circumstances lesson the operation of his mind onto new decision, new desire and new determination. Such time now finds expression in my political career which necessities vital change, fundamental decision and refreshing determination. It is therefore on this basis that I hereby declare the withdrawal of my membership from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to ACCORD Party of Nigeria (ACCORD). This is the political platform upon which my gubernatorial ambition shall be pursued to actualization by the guidance and grace of the Almighty Allah.

It is needless to restate in details, reason for relinquishing my APC membership on the point that such reason is public knowledge. The man dies in him who keeps silent in the face of blatant injustice and the life of a lie is a matter of little time. Evil people struggle in vain in their conspiracy against their innocent fellowman because malice is a poor match for destiny. What is important above all is that my leaders, supporters and teeming people of Oyo State are hereby assured of my determination never to disappoint them in the pursuit of my gubernatorial ambition to reality by the Will of God. I wish to present my humble self for the Political Liberation Movement to rescue our pacesetting state from the bad operation of clueless and inept people in Government and in the other Party. We shall together inaugurate a new Era of peace and Progress in our Dear State in line with my 7-Point Agenda when I become the Executive Governor by God's Grace in 2023. 

There is accord for our Vision in the ACCORD PARTY of Nigeria. We hereby move to therein accordingly.

May God guide , guard and bless EACH and ALL

Thank you.

6/2/22, 6:13 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Hello Ifedayo,

How are you? I hope you’re keeping up with the conversations about governance and politics in Nigeria doing your part to effect the transformation you’re expecting.

The Nigerian political space has been action-packed in the last two weeks. As you already know, we had the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) primaries in which we again demonstrated two things to Nigerians:
1.    The PDP is serious about ensuring that we make the right decisions for Operation Rescue Nigeria. For the PDP to have gone ahead to conduct its primaries even though the umpire, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), decided to change the rules in the middle of the game shows that we are a truly formidable force to reckon with. The weaker party had to wait for the results of the PDP convention before they made their move.

2.    The PDP stands head and shoulders above the rest in coordinating primaries at the state and national levels. Almost all results are in, and we had rancour-free deliberations. So, those who tell you that the PDP and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are the same are not being honest. We all saw and watched the primaries play out, and a winner emerged. The result was the will of the majority, which is what democracy is all about.

Let me then take this opportunity to once again congratulate our party’s flagbearer, HE Atiku Abubakar, for his victory in the primaries. We will play our part to ensure that the PDP’s Operation Rescue Nigeria is a resounding success.

On a governance note, we visited the Ibadan Circular Road project yesterday and assessed the impact it would have on the ongoing Ajoda New Town Estate. From our assessment, a few of the constructed houses will be affected, and we are having conversations with the contractors about how to navigate the disruption. We are determined to deliver the Ibadan Circular Road project to our people, and Craneburg Construction Company has already started work on the bridges and interchanges.

Let me end this newsletter by saying that if you want to come into politics and make a change in the system, the time to do that is now. Join a political party and be part of the process of building the structure. 2027 is not as far away as you may think.

Talk to you again soon.

6/2/22, 6:30 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I got to Ibadan yesterday evening and I travelled briefly to Osun State this morning. I saw the ongoing Ibadan Circular Road project on my way to Osun. I took Odeyale-Ajia road from Amuloko and I got to Badeku (close to Oyo/Osun boundary) in less than 20 minutes. Very smooth road. 
I could hardly recognize Iwo Road again, I didn’t know the ongoing Bus Terminal at Iwo Road will be constructed at both sides of the road Massive one I must say. MASSIVE. We need make more noise about Seyi Makinde’s achievements. Man is a BEAST!

4+4 is a done deal. ✌️

In a kingdom built on the bedrock of knowledge,
Where we live in harmony, peace and love,
In a twinkle of an eye, we were sent packing,
Who dares question the authority?

Who was born of tiger-flesh to boldly speak the truth,
That our stay there isn’t on platter of gold,
The tuition fee we paid wasn’t for offering,
What an injustice to student populace!

When I should be on campus dealing with books and texts,
When my concern should be excelling in my studies,
I become a prayer warrior matching on praying track days and nights,
Just for those failures to reach a compromise.

New year, Sallah and Christmas all come but once,
I didn’t know when ASUU strike joined the league,
The only festival that stays for months,
Someone must have cursed this country in silence.

6/2/22, 10:11 PM - +234 817 014 8364: While passing a motor park, you'll hear bus conductors shouting their different destinations to anyone that is passing.

Here is the *fact*... 
*They talk to over 100 people just to fill a 14 seater bus,* they don't get discouraged if you are not going to their destination. *They do that several times daily*, that's how life and business is, do not expect everyone to embrace your idea or to be heading to your destination.
 
*Keep talking to people to get that few that will skyrocket your business 💥*. 

*💯👌Never Get Discouraged If You Must Succeed In Business*, And Never You Stop Telling People About The Opportunity That Abounds In WHAT YOU SELL👌💯

*💯👌Success Is Never By Chance, Nor A Mistake, Nor Coincidence, It's By Hardwork, Persistence And Consistence, Above All... NEVER GIVE UP👌💯*

How has Atlantic City benefited the man on the street
 And sneaking in ECONET as if we won't notice ba 😂

POV: He only invested in ECONET like every other investors
6/2/22, 10:29 PM - +234 809 866 4771: This should ans all ur question sir's
6/2/22, 10:32 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Is it is fault that somebody can not continue that?

*point of corrections to BAT!*

THE INTERCESSION OF PYO made DA to became the Governor of ogun state not BAT as quoted.

BAT DROPPED HIS PRESIDENTIAL AMBITION IN 2015 DUE TO PARTY STRUCTURE THEN. I.e Muslim Muslim ticket that brought PYO to from the south west to ruin with PMB also to use the religion block of RCCG.  

Tommorow I will try to oblige us the real hard fact about this claim by BAT.

6/2/22, 11:23 PM - +234 703 446 8168: I laf some of my PDP cohorts that say BAT is chasing his Lifelong ambition.

ATIKU was ABIOLA’s opponent in 1992 SDP primaries!

Vice President from 1999-03

Persuaded from contesting primaries in 03 and then became VP 2003-07 

He was AC/N’s candidate in 2007

Lost the primaries in 2011 (maybe)

Lost the primaries to BUBU in 2015

PDP’s flagbearer in 2019

PDP’s flagbearer in 2023

Make we channel that energy to the both sides!

I don’t want to talk about those shippinni-ogoless parties Abeg

6/3/22, 8:17 AM - +234 811 852 9190: *THE DIE IS CAST*
Tinubu's outburst and sheer rudeness on Thursday in Abeokuta  is the clearest indication that he already knew that his lifelong ambition will never be realised. At least not within the APC.

The way and manner he came across, in a "don't care" attitude exhibited the very signs of a battle leader going down fighting. How could you be so respectful to Northern Governors, and then treat your fellow Yorubaman, a Governor with so much disdain and disrespect all because you claimed to be instrumental to his being in that position. 

In Tinubu's world, without him there wouldn't be President Buhari, without him, there wouldn't be Vice President Osinbajo, without him, there wouldn't be Governor Abiodun....Ha-ha! Kilode?

If practically no one could have been without you, perhaps the question should be asked: Who made BAT who he is today? In all his tirades so far, I have not seen or heard him acknowledged anyone for his rise to power in politics, first as a Senator, and then the Governor of Lagos. Or did he get to those exalted position all by his own power.

Enough of all this bravados. No one can see himself as Mr Know-all. Life is full of battles, some you win, some you lose. It is not by force if you want to be a leader, for if you get it by force nobody else will matter to you. You'll see yourself as conqueror, an Emperor who wouldn't allow anyone to rise above him.

Since it is now clear to BAT that he could not get what he wants, shouldn't it be better for him to relax his muscles and enjoy his spoils from the largesse of the people of Lagos, rather than throwing a dynamite into his political dynasty on his way to retirement. 

Time is indeed running out for him to come to graceful reality, rather than being pushed into ignominious end of a once  robust profession.

No one is indispensable in life, and no one can play God over people all the time. 
Af'emi, Af'emi .... l'oba akoko se t'ofite. I can't stand this arrogance any longer. Monday the 6 of June cannot come quicker. That we may end all this self aggrandizement.

6/3/22, 7:45 PM - +234 813 948 8163: Oyegun panel clears Tinubu, Osinbajo, 11 other APC presidential aspirants

Chief John Odigie Oyegun All Progressives Congress Screening Committee has cleared the party’s National Leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to contest the primary election at the coming National Convention of the party from June 6-7.

Chief Oyegun announced earlier today that 13 of the aspirants have been cleared with the indication that 10 were not cleared.

Our correspondent gathered that Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, Yahaya Bello, Godswill Akpabio among others were cleared to contest the primary election.
 
A source close to the panel said nobody was disqualified in the real sense of the word because only 13 of the 23 aspirants appeared before the screening panel adding that the 10 aspirants that didn’t appear before the panel were not presented to the party.

Nobody was disqualified. Only 13 aspirants appeared before the Oyegun panel. All the 13 of them were considered able and competent to be President,” the source revealed.

The 13 cleared aspirants are billed to collect their clearance certificate later today or tomorrow morning.

6/3/22, 10:49 PM - +234 905 302 0945: Governor Abiodun never issued any statement in response to Asiwaju Tinubu ---Ogun Govt 


The attention of the Ogun State Government has been drawn to comments purportedly made by Governor Dapo Abiodun in reaction to statements made by the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and presidential hopeful,  Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, during his recent visit to party delegates in the state.

For the avoidance of doubt, the tweet released this morning (https://twitter.com/dabiodunMFR/status/1532661227645804545?t=Xg0DJ-tFIf749cYZuLQ5Rw&s=19 ) was an extract to re emphasize the comments of Governor Abiodun to party faithfuls and appointees on May 29 during the celebration of his third year in office, which also coincided with his 62nd birthday.

The comments could, therefore, not have been a response to comments by Asiwaju Tinubu whose visits to Abeokuta came five days later.

While Governor Abiodun appreciates the media, including online platforms, as partners in progress with Government, he enjoins media practitioners to always report the truth at all times and refrain from giving vent to fake news, distortions and misinterpretations .

Having painstakingly read through this write up, am highly disappointed with this piece !

 And I don't think this writeup has made any changes or development in the foregoing subject matter, rather I see it as a state of being still a coward which has brought the entire Gateway state indigenous under the carpet of ridicule.

Well, in my own little corner I will continually banter the said BAT and his cohort for that ridicule statement on our state man!.😡😡

Doing this shows we are concerned about the future of our great nation Nigeria. 
However, let us learn to respect each other’s Political choices. 

Do not forget the path to the right choice doesn’t pass through only your house.  We all have different views of the world around us, and our beliefs and opinions differ. 

Do not see anyone who is not rooting for your candidate as an enemy or that of the nation. Just support your candidate and allow others to support theirs as well. May God take this Nation to a greater height.

African Community is A Patriarchal One, A Man is the head, and sits on top of the family chain at every point. So this is illustrative image borne outta boredom and limited knowledge or lemme say Shallow assumption.
6/4/22, 7:27 PM - Adufe: Hmmmmm
6/4/22, 7:36 PM - +234 701 339 3964: You mean claiming to be the head while it's the wife that actually takes care of the family

6/4/22, 7:37 PM - +234 810 206 9268: What type of men do you know and are around you?
6/4/22, 7:37 PM - +234 903 749 0597: That it happens in respective families doesn’t mean it happens the same way everywhere. 
Okay?

6/4/22, 7:39 PM - +234 810 206 9268: Many of us watched our fathers abandon their dreams to train us

So that’s a bias illustration

6/4/22, 7:40 PM - +234 701 339 3964: True but majority of the family I know and who are around me,it's actually the women who takes care of the family
6/4/22, 7:41 PM - +234 701 339 3964: Like the fact that you used MANY OF US but on a scale of 1 to 10 how many
6/4/22, 7:42 PM - +234 701 339 3964: We probably grew up in different worlds
6/4/22, 7:42 PM - +234 903 749 0597: Highly understandable 💯, your assertion is hence borne outta experiences around you. Yet that ain’t an African Man in anyway, a Traditional African Man shoulders responsibilities of the wife kids and even in-laws 😂.
6/4/22, 7:43 PM - +234 903 749 0597: Of course that’s why I said personal experiences shouldn’t be solely interpreted as norm.

The 2 scenario both exist in an African setting
6/4/22, 9:12 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Probably you speak for yourself based on your experience and upbringing.....

Some fathers are not responsible and it's not debatable
6/4/22, 9:12 PM - +234 810 206 9268: Some are not, but generalising that mothers are the sole carriers of the hiuse as an African

Did you see the picture at all

If you have an irresponsible husband or father you need to look for who trained them and query them, because men are naturally responsibility oriented
6/4/22, 9:20 PM - +234 906 684 1637: Abeg abeg

6/4/22, 10:41 PM - +234 905 989 7451: Tinubu, Osinbajo, Amosun and Dapo Abiodun  - PART 2 and source of "ELEYI"

Another interesting part was when DA himself approached the Osinbajo that he will be needing funds for the election and he would be needing the support of the VP. This didn't go down well with the VP. The VP again and for the last time approached Oshiomole that if there is any way names could be substituted to give peace and bring Amosun's candidate who has financial back up on board but the chairman refused vehemently. Words got to Asiwaju and Akinrogun Osoba again whom both at different times provided a total financial war chest of over N2bn!!! Yes you heard me right over 2 BILLION NAIRA!!!

Akinrogun Osoba through Corporate Sector Support (CSS) also got DA a financial support of over N1bn!!! While Asiwaju via Oshimole officially released N800m for DA's election. The VP only actively gave support during the election when every other things has been sorted by Asiwaju with Yayi's providing structure. Osinbajo was only in charge of the security architecture. He actually played that part so so well. 

So when the VP came to meet delegates and party stakeholders in Ogun State in April, DA for whatever reason chose to rewrite history and decided to throw past genuine efforts into the dust bin. He said to the delegates and party stakeholders that the VP was the reason why he's a Governor today while denigrating his main benefactor, and he's saying this because he's aware that some of the delegates and stakeholder have AMNESIA!(in his word).

For every action, there is always an opposite reaction. Asiwaju needs to set the record straight. He's human. He feels betrayed. This same steadfastness of Oshiomole on this DA's primary cost him his position. That's a huge sacrifice for the Governor to rubbish. "Eleyi" is one of the least ways Asiwaju could have used to describe someone that threw sacrifices of so many into the thrash can without even blinking!

This is politics! Osinbajo didn't contribute a dime! The only name Oshiomole forwarded for political appointment was thrown into the thrash bin by the Governor. That person is a politician from Ogun state too. This was one of the major reasons why Amosun also destroyed Adeosun.

Lastly, before anyone reacts to Tinubu's statement in Abeokuta, be sure you know the story behind it. The fact! 

Yoruba will say "Isoro ni igbesi".

6/4/22, 10:44 PM - +234 809 866 4771: *Statement by Northern States’ APC Governors and Political Leaders*


APC governors and political leaders from the northern states of Nigeria today met to review the political situation and to further support our Party in providing progressive leadership amidst our national challenges. 

During our discussions, we welcomed President Muhammadu Buhari’s invitation to governors and other stakeholders to contribute to the emergence of a strong presidential candidate for the APC.  

After careful deliberation, we wish to state our firm conviction that after eight years in office of President Muhammadu Buhari, the presidential candidate of the APC for the 2023 elections should be one of our teeming members from the southern states of Nigeria. 

It is a question of honour for the APC, an obligation that is not in anyway affected by the decisions taken by another political party. We affirm that upholding this principle is in the interest of building a stronger, more united and more progressive country.

We therefore wish to strongly recommend to President Muhammadu Buhari that the search for a successor as the APC’s presidential candidate be limited to our compatriots from the southern states. 

We appeal to all aspirants from the northern states to withdraw in the national interest and allow only the aspirants from the south to proceed to the primaries. 

We are delighted by the decision of our esteemed colleague, His Excellency, Governor Abubakar Badaru to  contribute to this patriotic quest by withdrawing his presidential aspiration.  

The APC has a duty to ensure that the 2023 elections offer a nation-building moment, reaffirming that a democratic pathway to power exists for all who value cooperation and build national platforms. 

This moment calls for the most sober and inclusive approach to selecting our party’s candidate, and we call on all APC leaders to fulfil their responsibility in this regard. 

Signed, 4th June 2022:

Aminu Bello Masari Governor of Katsina State

Abubakar Sani Bello Governor of Niger State

Abdullahi A. Sule Governor of Nasarawa State

6/5/22, 12:47 AM - +234 809 866 4771: STATE HOUSE PRESS RELEASE

PRESIDENT BUHARI TO APC PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANTS: CONSULT, BUILD CONSENSUS, AND COME UP WITH FORMIDABLE CANDIDATE
 
President Muhammadu Buhari Saturday night met with all the aspirants for President on the platform of All Progressives Congress, at State House, Abuja, urging them to hold consultations, and come up with a formidable candidate before the party holds its primary election between June 6-8, 2022.
 
The President said the meeting was a continuation of the on-going consultative process aimed at ensuring a smooth and strategic emergence of a standard bearer, who will lead the APC to a resounding victory in the upcoming presidential polls.
 
“Looking at this assemblage of personalities and considering your rich pedigree of accomplishments in life, I have come to the conclusion that our party, the APC, is rich in human resources and also that our nation is blessed with capable people that can successfully steer the ship of state into the future,” President Buhari said.
 
He added that with his first-hand knowledge of the demands of the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the expectations of the citizens, “I must salute your courage and your selfless spirit, in volunteering to serve in the highest office of the land.”
 
The President added: “Our party, the APC, has won two successive presidential elections in 2015, first when we were in the opposition and in 2019 when I sought re-election. Both processes were achieved through unity of purpose, strategic alignment, consultation, fairness, determination and effective leadership.  In both instances, national and party interests were overriding factors in our deliberations and decision-making.
 
“The 2023 General Elections are fast approaching in a global, regional and national environment that is constantly changing and challenging. This demands that our party should become more aware of the changing environment, be responsive to the yearnings of our citizens, re-evaluate our strategy and strengthen our internal mechanism so that we would sustain the electoral successes.
 
“I am pleased to note that the party, recognizing the significance of all these demands, has over time developed several democratically acceptable processes and policies, that promote consultation, internal cohesion and leadership to facilitate victories at the polls.”
 
The President recalled the consultation he had held with stakeholders “that would help the electoral fortunes of our party, beginning with the State Governors. This is the second in the series and I still look forward to meeting with party stakeholders. These steps are being taken to ensure that the unity and cohesion of the party are sustained and to provide direction.
 
“Amongst others things, I reminded the APC Governors of the need for the party to proceed to the 2023 Presidential elections with strength, unity of purpose and to present a flag bearer who will give Nigerians a sense of hope and confidence, while ensuring victory for our party. I extend a similar reminder to all of you distinguished aspirants.”
 
Saying the APC will on Monday June 6, 2022 commence its national convention during which one candidate will be picked by delegates to fly the flag of the party for the 2023 Presidential Election, President Buhari said he was aware that there is anxiety among party members about the outcome of the process.
 
“Given these circumstances, I charge you to recognize the importance of the stability and unity of the party, which cannot be overemphasized.
 
“Similarly, I wish to remind you that our choice of flag bearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges.
 
“Ahead of the Convention, the party machinery has screened and found all aspirants eminently qualified. Recognizing this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.
 
“Without prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, with a view to building a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.”
 
The President assured that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would continue to provide effective leadership during the transition processes and on-going consultations, “until we successfully make the choice on the candidate that will fly the flag of our party for the presidential elections and make the party stronger.

The space was quite interesting, it was a bant dominated 💯% by them until @2348163162679  and I spoke on the space.

I didn’t engage them to win because I’m not ignorant of their numbers and records. Instead, I put it out to them the great things & few great persons from TASUED.

Quite a number of them were not aware of TASUED is, they called it a ‘GLORIFED SECONDARY SCHOOL’ (they are right afterwards) until we told them who we are.

Conclusively, they knew things they never know of TASUED and thus a new impression of TASUED was sent to them in AKURE & ONDO state at large!

Abeg, make we dey rest now…make we no go compete with any other federal institution Abeg!

I was saying with APC and PDP still taking the lead, our PVC is as good as our ATM to fetch naira on election day and @2348023964016 is saying that is why northerners will always be ahead of us, so I don’t understand how.

This is not Tasued election…
You need that PVC to reclaim your dignity and integrity…
Forget if your candidate loose or not…
So if you don’t have a PVC…
Get one…
If you picture your PVC like an ATM card…
Then get ready to face deduction after transaction…
Even if think PDP or APC are leading then you’re lying to yourself…

We will both witness 2023 election inshallah and you will see how people will be dumbing APc/pdp just to vote for Peter and people of other  parties.
6/5/22, 4:55 PM - +234 816 463 6464: You're still wrong with your narrative in my opinion and that's because we all have this belief that it's only the 2 most popular that can win major election in Nigeria.....

There might be an element of truth in it but it's still false because it's we the citizen that made the 2 party popular..... APC was a party struggling to get to the National level pre 2015 election...

What changed for them is the coalition of different parties coming together to form a formidable force with their supporters going with them.... ACN with its supporters, ANPP, CPC and the nPDP with their supporters as well....

And who made up the supporters, *WE* the masses. 

So I would say it's doable if we want to get the two parties out of the way but we're not ready....

*WE'RE ALL BUNCH OF HYPOCRITES*
6/5/22, 4:57 PM - +234 816 463 6464: God bless you for this...... Election at a point will not be about WINNING but sending a message.....

People at Ifon, Sabongida Ora should form defense group and block the way immediately.

Same thing, people at Imeri axis should stop all vehicles coming from Ibilo to Owo immediately.

Police at Okada should be at alert as crossing the river to escape is the first choice for the terrorists.

For over months that we have moved into election period, which set of youths or any party seriously ready with their ready? Absolutely none! This same we youths have occupied the  with apc/pdp, we don’t miss a gist of what is happening there and no one is even concerned about youth party we all clamoured for.

I sometimes wrote here in we raising our voice to have youth president but no youth is even ready. All our social media is full of pdp and apc and no one is talking about youths party, how then is pvc a tool to reclaim sanity?
6/5/22, 5:13 PM - +234 816 463 6464: I would say they should rather not have the PVC now if they're not ready to make their vote change Nigeria.....

And y'all think we're normal humans in this country....

Most of us have posted/talked about the massacre but in few weeks time, we will all be banting ourselves on why lagbaja is better than tamedo......

HYPOCRISY kill all of una

6/5/22, 10:53 PM - +234 802 396 4016: On a serious note…
It really hurts seeing people praising Buhari or clapping for him…
It really make no sense!!

There is no insecurity issues that have been resolved in Buhari regime completely…
The vp is of no difference…

The way some people keep on clapping for mr president..,
Na to just keep quiet..
Moreover they’re entitle to there own opinion…
But it’s a big slap to our generation

Only North vote don't decide Nigeria election again.

Will he rule the animals if eventually he becomes president and all citizen has been killed?

6/5/22, 11:15 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Like I said, you have been wired to defend Atiku......

Yes I campaigned massively and pull support for Buhari in 2015 and fast forward to Nov 2016, I started to see what i couldn't see before his emergence because APC campaigned based on propaganda IMO...

And in 2019, I gave my support to a new face in the game.... But that's not why we're here....

My rant tonight is about why you lots that call yourself youth fail to see that with the way the country is being managed, we might not have somewhere to call a home.....

While I dished out what's for PDP, I also did for APC but due to the blind followership you're practising you picked a defence in someone that is not even aware of your existence

Someone who couldn’t stand for Christians just because he is protecting his political ambitions?

Let the truth be said..

This is to notify the general public that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and the leading APC presidential aspirant, was not involved in any accident this morning.

Vice President Osinbajo was on his way to Owo, Ondo state over the dastardly terrorist attack of yesterday when his convoy met an accident scene on airport road, Abuja. He immediately stopped his convoy and asked his ambulance to take the victims to the hospital and report to him on the state of the accident victims. He immediately proceeded to board his flight to Akure. 

His media office would issue a comprehensive statement very soon.

6/6/22, 12:40 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I met Omoyele Sowore @ Radison Blu Hotel GRA, IKEJA around 2018, We  chatted about his political Ambition and the registration of African Action Congress political party(Note that Leonard Ezenwa Registered the party and not sowore) and on that faithful day I promised to support his Ambition by joining AAC, Contested for Elective position and won through a congress Held @ Sahara Reporters Lagos office. The Take it Back(TIB) members following sowore refused to contest  for the elective positions of the party because they believed they are Above US and the party as at then. Before the 2019 Election, Sowore Organized a National Congress in Lagos to Elect National Executives of the party but he cancelled the congress and declared himself the presidential candidates of the party while still holding on to the position of National Chairman of the party. Sowore and his Cults Starved the AAC Party from surviving and left us without building a single structure. Sowore believe he can win a major election from social media. After Sowore lost the Election to APC, He started the REVOLUTION now movement to remove president Buhari under the umbrella of AAC. The Leadership of AAC discovered this evil motives to destroy our party and suspended Sowore, conducted a FREE,FAIR and Credible party election in Owerri and Dr, Leonard Ezenwa was Elected the National Chairman of the party. This is the true story of what happened in the AAC party that made the party members to expelled him and his Cults members from the party.  Don't believe the FAKE story spreading around that Sowore has taken over the party through a court Judgement, Na Propaganda to chop your money and destroy the party further. 

Sowore is never a serious contender. 

Sowore will continue to scams gullible Nigerians of their HARD earned money in the name of contesting for the office of the president.  AAC will not give him party TICKET.

Nigerians should be wise! Sowore is a comedian and a GUY MAN.

I have PAID my dues and suffered under sowore and in AAC party in the past but my loyalty now is 100% dedicated to building the party to greater HEIGHT in Lagos state.

INEC RECORDS till today still shows my Amiable National chairman as the authentic and substantive chairman of AAC.

COMMENT ON THE STATEMENT MADE BY A LEADING APC FLAGBEARER CANDIDATE
 
It is perhaps not surprising that on the eve of the All Progressives Congress (APC) flagbearer primary there are those running as candidates who wish to associate themselves with the President’s rise to elected office seven years ago.
 
There are many people who played parts large and small in his historic election in 2015, making history as the first opposition candidate to defeat a sitting president with power changing hands peacefully at the ballot box.
 
There are those who advised the President to run again; those who decided to build a political party – the APC – that could finally be the political vehicle capable of delivering victory where all other opposition parties and alliances before it had failed.
 
Those decisions may have been agreed upon by a few. But they were delivered by thousands and voted for by tens of millions. No one can or should claim to have made the possible.
 
Yet as important as that moment was, it is not what should decide the next general election.
 
What matters is the future: the policy platforms, the ideas, the drive, and the determination to take over the President’s stewardship of our country and build upon his legacy to make our country better than it has ever been.
 
The person most demonstrable in those qualities is the one to lead our party and our country forward.

6/6/22, 6:53 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): BREAKING: Oyo Deputy Gov’s Aides, Others Dump Him, Reaffirm Loyalty, To Makinde, PDP
 
 

A group of political allies and associates of Oyo state deputy governor, who are currently members of the present Seyi Makinde led government have dissociated themselves from the defection move by the Engr Rauf Olaniyan from the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to the opposition party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).

The group in a press statement dated 5th of June obtained by Western Mirror on Monday June 6 quoted the group as saying “We wish to state that we remain as PDP members and have absolutely nothing to do with the All Progressives Congress to which the Engr Rauf Olaniyan has moved into.”

Read full statement below:

Deputy Governor’s Defection To APC: We Remain Loyal To The Party And Committed To The Leadership Of Governor Seyi Makinde

The defection of the Deputy Governor, Engr. Rauf Aderemi Olaniyan from the PDP to the APC has been a subject in the news for a while. Even though this move is, of course, an open secret which has been envisaged among political watchers and newsmen, We have, as Political associates of the Deputy Governor, refrained from speaking about it to anyone either in the open or in our private life.

Our decision to keep mum on the defection speculations, before it was finally confirmed by the Deputy Governor, was borne out of absolute respect for the office and person of the Deputy Governor, Engr. Rauf Olaniyan with the hope that the speculations would eventually not become a reality.

Even though our unwavering loyalty to the Governor, His Excellency, Engr Seyi Makinde and commitment to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has somewhat denied some of us privileges and opportunities for a long time, our independent-mindedness and objective disposition to what is right or wrong has created in us a conviction that it pays to stand for a just course devoid of personal sentiments or emotions.

It is on this note we wish to unequivocally reaffirm our absolute loyalty to Governor Seyi Makinde who has not only restored our sense of pride and honour with his purposeful leadership, but also reshaped the political landscape across the length and breath of Oyo state and Nigeria as a whole.

We also wish to state that we remain as PDP members and have absolutely nothing to do with the All Progressives Congress to which the Engr Rauf Olaniyan has moved into.

We also re-dedicate ourselves to the PDP and will continue to be committed and loyal to Governor Seyi Makinde and our great party.

Our decision to remain committed and loyal PDP members is not an act of disloyalty to Engr. Rauf Olaniyan and should never at any point be misconstrued as such because we are men of freewill. Engr. Rauf Olaniyan himself would often say ” Politics is Free Entry And Free Exit”. To this extent, he was quoted by some online medium as also noting that ” Governor Makinde should not see his decision to take another path politically in 2023 as an act of disloyalty, because it is not”.

It is our hope that he will also apply that same line of thought to our decision.

We humbly wish wish Engr. Rauf Olaniyan best of luck in his present political sojourn.

6/6/22, 7:57 PM - +234 809 866 4771: *BREAKING: Tinubu Breaks Silence Over Lawal Emergence As APC Consensus Candidate.*

 
The media is inundated with reports that the Chairman of the All progressives Congress (“APC”) has unilaterally announced the purported adoption of a 
certain aspirant the consensus presidential candidate of the APC for the forth coming presidential election in 2023. While the National Chairman is yet to deny or offer any clarification on the alleged declaration, it is necessary to state that such a declaration is a legal impossibility. This is because under the regime of the Electoral Act 2022, consensus, though provided for as one of the means by which a political party may produce its candidate, must specifically occur in a precise form. 

Section 84(9) (10) and (11) of the Electoral Act 2022 are the relevant provisions and they state as follows:
“(9) A political party that adopts a consensus candidate shall secure the written consent of all cleared aspirant for the position, indicating their voluntary withdrawal from the race and their endorsement of the consensus candidate”.


(10) Where a political party is unable to secure a written consent of all cleared aspirants for the purpose of a consensus candidate, it shall revert 
to the choice of direct or indirect primaries for the nomination of candidates for the aforesaid elective position.

(11) A special convention or nomination congress shall be held to ratify the choice of consensus candidates at designated centers at the National, 
State, Senatorial, Federal and State Constituencies, as the case may be”.

Instructively, none of the above conditions have occurred in respect of producing the presidential candidate of the APC. Therefore, any declaration of a consensus candidate would be premature and a violation of extant provisions of the law. 

We are confident that as a law-abiding entity, the APC will not be part of such. We are further persuaded to urge our supporters to disregard this report 
considering that the overwhelming majority of the APC Northern Governors who, after meeting with the President, re-affirmed their preference for a 
president from the Southern part of Nigeria. This patriotic decision is widely accepted by all Nigerians as a demonstration of deep understanding of the 
nuanced fault lines of our nation.

In the circumstance, a unilateral declaration by the National Chairman of aconsensus presidential candidate for the party will not only violate the law, but set the party on collision course with its Governors who are critical stakeholders in the party. 

Thank you.

The APC governors, led by the chairman of their party, Adamu Abudulahi, are currently meeting the leader of their party, President Buhari, at ASO Rock.
 
The idea behind the meeting is to prune the number of contestants to achieve a consensus.
 
If they can't agree on something, APC delegates who are already in Abuja will vote for their favourite candidate today in a  secret ballot election. 
 
Adamu, who is in charge of the APC, wants Senate President Ahmad Lawan to be the party's consensus candidate. On the other hand, the APC governors want power to go back to the south and want a fair delegate election.
 
 
It is going to be a long night for the APC gladiators.
6/7/22, 2:23 AM - +234 814 235 8262: Missing APC chairman, Abudullahi Adamu has been found,praise God! 

After the meeting of the APC governors with NWC at the party secetariat which he was absent, read here:  https://www.sunnewsonline.com/apc-governors-nwc-meeting-end-in-deadlock-adamu-absent/

The missing chairman suddenly invited the APC governors to his house for a meeting. 

The meeting lasted for only one hour. 

While the party chairman is insisting on his candidate and senate president, Ahmad Lawan as the consensus candidate for the party. 

The APC governors with exception of one  of them want APC presidential ticket to go back to the South. 

I can exclusively report that the governors with Adamu, their party chairman are on their way to Aso Rock to see the leader of the party, President Buhari for final conclusion on the drama.

Watch the video of the missing chairman with the party governors below.

6/7/22, 7:05 AM - +234 903 224 4825: THE ENTITLED SURVIVOR III 

AbdulAzeez, AbdulMaleek 

I can never forget what tomorrow is. And the many tomorrows ahead. Yesterday is now older and bigger than me, bigger than you. The memories are now tools for the future. The glimpses and touches now reflect and count for a better time, kindred remembrance and the conquered struggles. 

I, sometimes used to feel hysterical. Heightened, incredibly intense with overwhelming emotions, a rage, a need to run away from this world, a sudden need to never speak to someone again. 

I had very well stayed collected in the face of toughest situations. Before the most intriguing and turbulent storms of my life. Dared the most risky. Gambled. Garbled, to stay safe and free. 

I stood aloof, distant to stain in hope for clean and brighter edge. The Kings and Queens of the world took their chances, walked in and out smoothly after robbing the dwindling paths, and their backs, - some worked not, so I just figured the top brass didn't bite. 

I have taken shots and shoot at. Created scenes and dramas with my actions, words and chats. While dramatic statements are effective attention grabbers, overstatement merely serves to try your listener's patience. So, in cases of my overlaps, I calmly maintain a glorified silence. No questions asked. 

I have been real. Wore standard suits of my own standard. Dreamed within my possibilities. Race at my pace. Share thoughts, visions and plans that are really conceivable. Have I been scared? Why not? I often worry how many drops would make a bucket-full pallet. I am ambivalent about the future, but, still calm. 

I am surviving trials and admitting fresh hurdles. I survived one. And many others. But quiet in dealing with them, struggled, prayed and believed very strongly. As well, humbled by manifestation of amazing grace, grades, unimaginable and unequalled accomplishments. And I have been thankful. And how could I not? 

I cannot help or join, be recruited into hating anyone. But I can disagree, I used to. Make fun of funny situations and persons. But I do not hate. I do not hate. I will not hate! My heart is full of love and compassion, and no more space. No space for resentments or ill will. 

I do not attribute luck to results of great efforts. Some try to undermine people's struggles, results, even successes in any endeavour to luck or mere fortune. I think that should not be. I admire acknowledging mastery in various pursuits and giving the credits. That's humane. 

I learned that everybody is different, nothing can make us reason the same and that they will not always see the world as I do. Not everyone will agree with my point of view and perspectives, and that's okay. I believe so much that our differences make us unique and strong. A diversity of ideas makes us all wiser. 

I'm not interested in symbolic gestures. I like realness, straight and frank talks. And truths. I don't negotiate with people who are fundamentally deceptive and I'm capable of a genuine compliment. But I accord respect, and treat people with the dignity they deserve. 

I value good counsel, and I am smart enough to know what I don't know. 

I care for my family. I love my parents and Q'AJ. And my siblings and friends all over. I've read hundreds of books, novels and scripts in my life. One claimed that love was the center of the universe. That it could heal any damage inside of us. That it was what we need to survive. I think I didn't disagree. 

I have grown accustomed to my station here. Enduring it as if it lost in a dream. But today, my eyes have been opened. Today, I awake. Forging on, my past shall not define me, even as I stand afeard a resurgence of my true vulnerabilities. The time has come at last to abandon that isle of fear. To depart, never to return. Fare thee well, O Home. Wait for my return no longer. Onward I must proceed with strength in each footfall. Evermore hunted with the memories of the man I used to be. For my old home, is now behind me. Faith remain my new home. 

I look back at everything now, and I realise how blessed and privileged I am. I don't know about you. And I think I've also got the best friends in the world. And all of you. 

I am rolled into one fiercely protective package. I am an entitled survivor.

Fayemi was Bitter with Ekiti Delegates who Transported themselves to Abuja instead of joining his Team in the Vehicle Provided. He is Negotiating with Lawani Ahmed whose Region has asked Aspirants from the Northern Area to Withdraw from the Race. Will Lawani Accept to Play with Fayemi or will he Team Up with Asiwaju will be Determined this Night. Also Ben Ayade and Godswill Akpabio are willing to Step Down for Asiwaju. We are likely to get only two Aspirants going to the Field tomorrow depending on how President Buhari is able to manage tonight's meeting with the Governors. The meeting with Board of Trustees couldn't reduce the Aspirants but the Governors could be made to Prevail on the Delegates from their States to tow a Voting Patern*

That's why there's so much cacophony on this app from political hustlers and mischief vendors  who claim they are dishing out authentic information. You wonder why they keep changing every one hour if they have access to the real goings-on. Every camp is winning at the moment until the game is over.

Left to me the only competent candidate that we need in Nigeria now is BAT, he is dogged and bold. We can't eat grammar and grammar can't get us to where we desire... All we want is a man who can step on toes and that man that can do that is Tinubu... 

I want us all to note this down, if Osinbajo emerges the change we desire has no relevance. Quote my words.👂🏽

6/7/22, 9:58 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): ISSUANCE OF TRANSCRIPT NOW DIGITAL IN UI - VC

The Vice Chancellor, Prof. K. O. Adebowale mni, FAS, has assured graduates of the University that difficulties and delays in processing and obtaining transcripts has now become a thing of the past. This he stated, is because the University has now adopted a digital approach in the processing of transcripts.

The Vice Chancellor made this statement while receiving the alumni of Sultan Bello Hall of the University of Ibadan in his office recently. 

Prof Adebowale stated that his management team, in recognition of the delay and difficulties usually involved in the issuance of transcripts in UI made it a priority to tackle the challenge, thereby introducing a digital approach which makes the process seamless and fast.

The Vice Chancellor congratulated the Sultan Bello Hall alumni on the 60th anniversary of the great Hall, which has bred  great men in the society.

While acknowledging a gap between the University of Ibadan and it's alumni, due to its inability to capture all students that have graduated from the University, Prof Adebowale assured all  that the University now seeks to bridge the gap.

The 13th Vice Chancellor of the University expressed the desire of his management to provide 100% accommodation for student in order to avoid detachment of the students who stay off campus from the University, and to address the  insecurity issues that they face. He therefore called on the University Alumni and friends to partner with the University in addressing this, by building affordable private hostels on campus.

He assured the Sultan Bello Hall alumni that the University has continued to commit considerable resources to sustain the Hall and other halls on campus, in order to ensure that their legacies live on. He however admitted that this has been a challenging task, given the paucity of fund and resources in the University. He therefore enjoined the University Alumni to support the University in this regard.

Prof Adebowale  congratulated and pledged the University's support to the Alumni of  Sultan Bello Hall in anyway required as they prepare for the commemoration of the 60th Anniversary of the Hall of great men in September.

Speaking prior to the Vice Chancellor, the team lead and Hall master of the Hall, Prof Dhikiru A. Yagboyaju stated that the visit was to intimate the University management of the intent and programmes to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the prestigious hall, and to seek the management's support. He appreciated the continued efforts of successive managements of the University in sustaining the legacy of the great Hall, of which they all have euphoric memories 

Also on the visit were the Hall warden, Dr O O. Oyebode, the Assistant Hall warden, Dr. Y.A. Babarinde,  past members of the hall executives, including Prof. Gbenga Larinde, Mr Kolawole Hamzat, Mr Muyiwa S. Adedayo, other members of the alumni, including the Director University of Ibadan Press, Mr O.M. Oladejo, Mr Bello M. Adetokunbo and Barr Taiwo Garba. Others include current Executive members and staff of the Hall.

Present at the occasion were the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Administration) Prof. E. O. Ayoola, the Dean of Students, Prof Adekeye Abiona and the Director, University Advancement Centre, Mr A.A. Adebowale Adeosun. Others include the Deputy Registrar (Vice Chancellor's Office) Mrs Morenike Afolabi and the Public Relations Officer, Mrs Adejoke Akinpelu among others.

OUR ENCOUNTER WITH DESTINY:

Here comes a time in a nation when the hopes of the moment. Let not the destiny of this land be stolen because we did not do what was meant for us to do at this critical moment. Remember, we formed this party not simply to wrest power from a wrong and failing PDP.

We formed this party to give the people of this land the progressive good governance they deserve so that they may live as well and as peacefully as any people on the face of this earth. This corrective journey began with the election of President Muhammadu Buhari. At this convention, we must take the next step toward the proper and necessary direction.

In 2015, the All Progressives Congress won the election to halt the drift in our nation's governance, redirect our path, and make clear our national priorities We dedicated this party to the guiding principle that government must be for the benefit or each and every Nigerian before it is for the benefit of any single one of ns, No one is above legal rule or regulation. Likewise one is too low for justice and compassionate governance cover or protect him.

Within this context, the APC under President Muhammadu Buhari has governed with patriotic and disciplined commitment this past seven years. The Buhari government has championed needed reforms, ranging from an innovative petroleum industry law to measures that are aimed at improving power and electricity generation for all Nigerians. Government has invested heavily in building modern airports and railway network and roads. Every Naira is better managed than in prior administrations.

This greater fiscal probity was achieved despite the vast reduction in national revenue caused by the COVID and recurrent global economic downturns. The Buhari government has done more with much less than its PDP predecessors did. The successive PDP administrations did next to nothing with the plenty they had. What they did with our nation's abundance is no secret. But what they did not do was even a greater embarrassment.

They left abandoned infrastructure projects all across the nation. The APC completed them. They allowed ISWAP/ Boko Haram to erect strongholds. The Buhari government has been compelled to wage great war against these threats because of the decade of neglect by the PDP.

The PDP should have uprooted this evil when it was but a seed. The APC-led government is now left to contend with the dangerous tree it has become. Yet, as surely as I can state my name, the next APC government shall uproot this evil such that, never again, shall it try to take hold in this land.

While fighting this evil with a purposeful hand, we remain mindful of the socio-economic and political inequalities that often spawn unrest and social instability. Despite economic difficulties wrought by protracted global recession, the APC-led government has progressed in diversifying the economy, improving food security through intense investment in the agricultural sector.

But the long day for national rebuilding is not over. Even greater, bolder work is needed to beat back the hard challenge swe face. Yet, my hope is high and that is hope not for myself but for you and this nation, My greatest trust and comfort reside in the innate goodness of the people of our beloved nation, Joiner in common purpose, with leadership informed by wise and correct policies, the things that we can accomplish are nothing less than historic.

We can change the very face of the nation Though this season of primaries has been abbreviated, I have talked to thousands of people across this land. Yes, there were crowds and jubilant receptions offered me. These were nice things, but they are not the most important factors to the task at hand. People approached me wanting to know if I had a plan to continue the fight against terror and violence.

They wanted to know if I cared about agriculture and the plight of the ordinary farmer. Youths asked me about jobs and their future in this world. The poor asked how and when they will be assured that they can daily place food on the table for their innocent children.

They did not ask for mage or for me to give them charming yet empty responses. Our people asked honest, serious questions and I gave then honest and serious answers I told them what we can achieve through hard work and dedication to a higher national purpose

I told them we must work harder than ever; but I also assured them that the average person shall not feel left behind, Building on the reforms of the past seven years and on the progressive ideals of our party, the coming APC-led government, under my watch, shall place the welfare of the average Nigerian above that of any elite or special interest. Our progressive government must be for the people and never for the powerful.

The powerful already have. Let us give succour and an open door to the less privileged. Let us bring forth a society built on shared prosperity, belief in justice, compassion for others and an unshakable commitment to a form of governance that treats all citizens with equal respect and due regard. Let us not just open the door to the promise of a better society. Let us brick by brick and stone by stone build a new society that begets a greater nation.

Weighty matters now rest in the balance. A fateful decision awaits you the delegates to this convention. Choose that which most wholly benefits the nation. Think big at this moment that we may accomplish great things in the next APC administration that will come on 29 May 2023.

My experience in office and the knowledge gained through hard work, tough trials and patient undertaking have prepared men for this hour. I am a man of purpose with a serious mission. My vow is to use all that I know and all of my abilities to the benefit of the nation and its people. I do not step forward because I think this nomination is my due. I step forward because I can help lead our nation to become what it ought to be.

I do not say this as a boast. Hear me out. I claim not to be special nor great. My training, experiences, acquired knowledge are what is special and uniquely suited for this moment. I am merely a conduit, a servant of a cause much larger than myself.

Now is a time for progressive vision and singular purpose. There is a general agreement that 2023 will be an encounter with destiny, when our nation shall need a certain type of leader to realise a better Nigeria.

We need to build a Nigeria where sufficient jobs for the urban population are available and lead to a good life most wholly benefits the nation. Think big at this moment that we may accomplish great things in the next APC administration that will come on 29 May 2023.

We need to build a Nigeria where sufficient jobs for the urban population are available and lead to a good life.

We need to encourage and support our farmers so that they can car enough to maintain their families, while feeding a growing nation We must continuously invest in the modernisation and expansion of infrastructure, including power, to enhance the quality of life of our people. Additionally, we must continue to empower the states so that grassroots economic and political development is maximised.

Though our tribe and tongue may differ, we must build a united country , premised on equity, fairness and justice. True reform and progress lie not in copying others but in identifying our own opportunities. I have done this in Lagos. I humbly ask you to allow me to use these skills and experiences to advance the nation.

I come to you with a coherent vision on how to improve our nation such that our schools, industry, agriculture and infrastructure will become the pride of all. Ours shall be a land where all Nigerians will have an equal chance and no one is excluded because of his ethnic background, religious creed, place of origin or social station. We are all Nigerians.

By this statement, Iseek your help and support to become our party's nominee and standard bearer in the coming February 2023 elections. To lead Nigerians is a sacred trust, which I do not take lightly or seek selfishly. By giving me the party's mandate, I hereby makey solemn vow to make Nigeria the best home for its citizens.

As an indivisible, united country, we shall overcome the destructive forces attempting to steal our destiny. May the triumph of our democratic journey be complete and serve as an exemplar to Africa, our race, and the rest of mankind. We were born for this moment. Let us now make the most of it.

I thank you all for listening.

May God bless you all.

May God Bless our party, the APC.

May God bless our beloved nation, the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

It wasn't a disservice when same was used for Buhari against GEJ
6/8/22, 12:33 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Many of us in Ogun saw it coming, amosun is doing everything possible to deal with abiodun and take that structure back fully, this does not exclude reconciling with people he fell out with, his recent silence was suspicious, it's just a pity that if tinubu gets that party ticket, they will change alot of name in Ogun state, I pity those aspirants sha😥

Just saying it's noticeable now bcos of the statistics

More northerners who are almost Muslims
Southerners are divided across both

If Buhari is a Christian, and someone steps down for a Muslim Candidate bcos he wants a Muslim to take over after 8 years of a Christian, would it has been a disservice???
6/8/22, 12:38 AM - +234 703 446 8168: He said…

Some ticket if voted if be a Muslim Muslim ticket, so desist from voting such ticket!
6/8/22, 12:38 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): That is actually amosun's main target, there was a time amosun said he won't do the second term and told his supporters then to watchout, don't be surprised that all those petitions written then will now start having meaning, it's gonna be a very longgggggg week😂

6/8/22, 12:41 AM - +234 807 434 7813: We have been informed of a text message going round APC delegates at Eagle Square, Abuja purportedly from Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, claiming that with his imminent victory at the APC Presidential Primary and emergence as the party's presidential candidate, the APC leader has now decided on a Muslim-Muslim ticket.

This is nothing but a lie. It has no basis whatsoever. 

We enjoin the distinguished delegates to ignore this completely.

The fake text message is a ploy by some undemocratic elements to confuse and hoodwink delegates sensing that Asíwájú Tinubu is comfortably coasting home to victory.

Truth is Asíwájú is destined for victory and no one can scuttle this through their shameful tactics.

Asíwájú is not known to jumping guns. He will deal with all important matters pertaining to his presidential pair at the appropriate time, after his victory has been fully established by the distinguished delegates.

6/8/22, 1:20 AM - +234 906 762 1398: Copied... The Next President; South East

APC is done with her National convention and it was very successful. The enemies of the party has been put to shame. Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the former governor of Nasarawa State was pronounced as our national chairman using consensus method.

I made a post over here on facebook on February 24th, where I listed the expectations of the public as APC convention gathered momentum then. In the said post I stated thus; 
1. APC's National convention won't be postponed again. The new date is definitive.

2. The incoming national chairman of APC will come from North-Central. Precisely a current senator and former governor a state that shares boundaries with Abuja.

3. The new national chairman will be elected using "Consensus method", the new chairman is expected to apply Consensus method too in electing our party's presidential candidate. This is firstly aimed at producing in a problem-free candidate and anointed choice of Mr. President too. Secondly is to minimize the plans of the enemies of APC from actualizing their dreams of disintegration of APC.

4. The incoming President of Nigeria come 2023, will come from South-East geopolitical zone. The anointed man is one of the arrow heads that formed APC. The person belongs to the old ANPP Block, one of the blocks that formed APC.

5. The incoming Vice President of Nigeria come 2023, will come from North-East geopolitical zone. The person belongs to the old CPC Block, one of the major blocks that formed APC too."'

I made other predictions but I won't go into it for want of time. You can revisit the said post again.
The above predictions from numbers 1 to 3 have come to reality. While we await for numbers 4 & 5.

Let me repeat this, if you are not close to His Excellency, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, the current minister for Science, Technology and Innovations. Please find your way to him or his political family, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu is going to fly APC's Presidential ticket come 2023. It may be sounding like a moon light tale but this is actually the reality. Those of us who are real APC members and are privileged to be close to the inner system of the party and her happenstances should be able to tell this better.

The political activities around Dr Ogbonnaya Onu in the last two days after the convention is a convincing fact that the deal is done and the die is cast. Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu is Buhari's Choice. Afternoon of Yesterday, the Chief of Staff to Mr President, Prof, Ibrahim Gambari hosted him in his residence Inside presidential villa. The two men had a closed door meeting which lasted for 2 hours. Your guess about the reason for the meeting is as good as mine. Just this morning as early as 5 am. The secretary to goverment of federation, Boss Mustpha in company of Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasiru El-rufai visited Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu at the minister's Asokoro residence. What are Boss and El-rufai coming at such time of the day for? I don't know. We have pictures but we won't publish it. The political space is very slippery at the moment.

The newly elected national chairman of APC himself can testify the role Onu played to ensure he emerged, Onu's group wanted senator Tanko Al-macura but Onu himself insisted he wanted Senator Adamu Abuduallahi even before Mr. President endorsed him. Who knows what he saw in Senator Adamu?

The man APC made the National Deputy Chairman, (South), Chief Emma Enukwu from Enugu State is Onu's Loyalist. All the past and present political positions Chief Emma Enukwu have occupied in Life was facilitated by His Excellency, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu. Make research about this. The position of Deputy National Chairman of APC, (South) was initially billed to be given to Senator Ken Nnamani, but about two weeks before convention, Chief Nnamani began to play a hide and seek kind of game, immediately Onu signaled Gov. Hope Uzodinma to inform him of his displeasure and Chief Nnamani was waved bye bye of his position.
His Excellency, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu is not a noise maker, he has paid his dues as far as Nigeria and  APC is concerned.

His Excellency Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu will be declaring for President by the second week of April.

6/8/22, 9:03 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): *Where is the Justice!!!*

Did Nigerians hear Dr Ogbonnaya Onu tonight? 

I mean his assertion that he personally brought the money with which APC was registered as a potential party;  that he contributed to 'bringing and nurturing' many members at the early stage of the APC Party's Mobilization. But still yet Many unconscious fellows would said that South East Nigeria have not ever invested enough in APC to get the Party Presidential tickets, Let me ask you, what's the like of Dr Onu been doing in APC? 

Also this same man who stood down his position as APP Presidential flag bearer in 1999 so that a Yoruba candidate could emerge through alliance,  apolitical atonement for the botched June 12?

Nobody in South West remember the like of Dr Ogbonnaya, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife also stepped down for Chief Samuel Olu Falae of the Alliance for Democracy, AD in 1999, A time when none of this aspirants today,  whether they be those of the ruling APC or PDP, had in mind any Presidential ambition. 

No body also remember that the like of Rochas Okorocha collapsed his   AGPA structure across the country into APC in form the Almighty APC in the early stage of the party formation, but  unconscious fellows still ask what is South East investment in APC... 

It is naturally the turn of south east Nigeria to produce the next President Nigeria. In APC the like of Dr Ogbonnaya Onu and Rochas Okorocha  is willing qualified for the Party tickets, to my Southwest brothers They should not forget in a hurry the sacrifices South East made in 1999 for the emergence of their Son as President,  My South South brothers,  should remember that south East stood for their son  GEJ, to my Northern brothers let's remember the sacrifices the like of Zik made in the past to place their son in power. 

It will be totally unfair if South East don't produce the Next President of Nigeria after PMB. 

Let's out according to uphold the motor of our Dear country Nigeria and to APC that of her Party. 

God bless Nigeria

Once there was an agreement that power should go to south, it automatically leaves out opponent from the north.

I said he didn’t meet with anyone nor put up any seriousness about it. 

You said he did it all lowkey. 
His lowkey is playing out now At Eagles Square

6/8/22, 9:20 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Yes. 
Only Bello was told specifically to step down. Why was Lawan still being tipped even after the South agreement by Northern Governors? 

If Yahaya Bello is as strong as being positioned, oju e o ni ri gbogbo nkan to ri yen
6/8/22, 9:21 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Na same thing we dey talk

Opening it, it was an electricity bill of £27.000 from Manchester which he was supposed to pay. 

"Oh No! This must be a mistake" He shouted! 
So he decided to call his former bosses.

 *"This must be a great error! I haven't been in Manchester for six years!"* 

No error Sir, that bill is for the trophy cabinet room.

6/8/22, 3:32 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I take a trip down memory lane

To my second attempt at winning a woman's heart

The first major attempt

Because the first one was through minor signs that she saw and read

I had made futile attempts in my head all through my secondary school

But my inferiority complex won't let me speak out

Coupled with the fact that I was too short

But after eating beans and Bread a lot of times

I shot up after secondary school

And work began on my self esteem

I had a good friend who stood by me in all

I got attracted to a lady in my class since my 100 level and I would tag along with her and keep following her

My schedule mattered a little when she was involved

We were friends

I, the lady, my friend who we lived together and his own female friend

My friend's female friend and the lady I am interested in were friends

Then in the first semester of 200 level, a new young lady joined us

As it was the tradition, they were direct entry students

They always had this airs around them as if they were more brilliant than those of us who started in 100 level

They move only in cliques that they have created

But truth be told only a few of them are actually brilliant

So these ones joined us and we watched for a while

Gradually, my friend and I got close to two of the ladies among them

And we became friends

During the first semester, it was foundation building

We read together and all

The first Lady I liked from 100 level noticed I always behaved differently around the direct entry lady

Then she told me during one of my visits to her hostel that I should shoot my shot at the new girl

She said, "See Idris, I'm in a committed relationship and I've seen all you've been doing since 100 level. I can't date you that's why I've just kept you as a friend. You've showed all your intentions in your actions. Now I see that you like that new direct entry girl whose is always with your guy with her friend. Go for her or should I do it for you?"

I was humbled. She had torn to shreds my cloak

I Sha shyly agreed to give it a trial though I was sad that she didn't date me

Fast forward to second semester

I started telling my friend that I liked this girl and would like to ask her out

My friend encouraged me

Truth is that she was closer to my friend than me

But being that we were both Muslims and my friend is a Christian I knew they couldn't date

Her friend was rather the liable candidate for my friend

I started learning how to toast again in my head

And towards the middle of the semester, I shot my shot

It was a memorable day that I wouldn't forget

That day we had a general course in the afternoon and I told her that I'd like to see her briefly after the class

I was wearing this cloth then called Ankara stuff or so

Throughout the class I was restless

I looked at my friend who gave me gingering eyes

Then the class ended and I went to seek her out

She was packing to leave and I reminded her that I wouldn't take her time

She said I should be brief that she had to go somewhere

We left the class and stood by a nearby small bush where I went into my first toasting attempt

"I know that we are friends and we've been like this since first semester. I think we can become an item around here if we take this further. I have been interested in ladies. The first one turned me down and the second showed me nothing. Throughout my secondary school, my shyness never allowed me talk to any girl. Those two before now were through playful jokes. But here I am hoping that you'll be my final bus stop. In this race called love relationship. There's this fluttering feeling I have and it's been said to be called love. I think I love you. I'd like to know if the feeling is mutual and if you'd be my final bus stop. Thank you."

I thought u had tasted successfully

But the looks on her face were far from impressive

It was more if pity

She stood there listening to my takes and rambling

And when I ended she was relieved

Her response was brief

"I think you haven't got to the final bus stop. I'm sorry but we can only be friends. I'm in a relationship."

I was sad and disappointed

I bore it with a smile and strode off to meet my friend

Till I left school, I didn't make another attempt...

6/9/22, 10:48 AM - +234 810 619 9957: And u are saying buhari is to indirectly
6/9/22, 10:49 AM - +234 703 446 8168: When I say don’t celebrate mediocrity by  praising GEJ over PMB, I have told you numerously they are both failures.

Even with this evidence brought forward by @2348026045965, you have only nailed yourself further.

• It took GEJ only 4 years to deplete our GDP by approximately 4% despite Nigeria having the biggest oil boom of her history under him and yet nothing to show for it.

• It took PMB 7 years to deplete the economy by approximately 4% with at least some railways and roads to show for it.


The last two presidents are failures considering our past! Even one doubles the other in the rate of GDP depletion.

When you bring issues like this up next time, don’t just check the numbers, check the progression and regression with statistical facts.

Once again, the only same democratically elected president is late Umaru Musa YAR’ADUA.

You can argue this with better statistical fact on the numbers above.

Thank you.

That statistics is the average GDP within that period, which means they are took the GDP beyond and below this figures at some points (Mean Statistics)

A part of that 7.98 of Yarudua happened when Jonathan was acting too, which stains the integrity of the figure

The best statistics to use is:

GDP as at takeover (exact) vs GDP at handover/realtime of calculation, you will then see that Nigeria has went into multiple recessions too often to be called even a developing nation.

6/9/22, 11:46 AM - +234 810 815 2940: It’s so shocking that Kingsley Moghalu and Chukwuka Monye both lost the ADC Presidential ticket. Who would have ever thought? These men made the party popular. What could have happened? Most people don’t even know who Dumebi Kachikwu is.
6/9/22, 11:46 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Las las, na PO go be the flagbearer
6/9/22, 11:47 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Most delegates who voted for Dumebi Kachikwu, an unknown ADC candidate who has not shared any vision, no manifesto, no campaign, no visibility at all over @MoghaluKingsley by collecting $100 each were YOUTHS. Makes you wonder if youths were really different from the old school🤷🏿‍♂️

6/9/22, 5:53 PM - +234 906 762 1398: "I congratulate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his victory at our party primaries and his emergence as the Presidential Candidate and Flagbearer of our great party, the APC for the forthcoming 2023 Presidential Elections.

I also congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari and all leaders of the APC for a successful Special Convention and Presidential Primary. 

For many decades, our Flagbearer has shown passion, patriotism, courage and determination in the cause of nation-building. His sterling contributions to our democracy and its progress stand him out.  His wealth of experience will certainly be critical in our party’s continued efforts to attain a more secure and prosperous Nigeria. 

To all members of our great party, regardless of who you voted for at the primaries, we must now unite behind our Presidential Candidate and Flagbearer to ensure victory for our party in the 2023 elections. 

As true progressives, we must remain strong and united in pursuing our collective vision as a party toward building a country that can provide a decent life and livelihoods for all our people.

Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN
Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

6/9/22, 9:19 PM - +234 906 762 1398: I congratulate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his emergence as the Presidential candidate of our great party, the All Progressives Congress, for the 2023 presidential election.

I am optimistic that this soldier of democracy who has seen it all will lead our great party to victory.

From Asiwaju's NADECO days to the ACN era and then to his immeasurable contribution to the formation of APC and its subsequent ascension to power, there is no doubt that he has laboured and sacrificed for democracy and its enthronement in our nation.

Therefore, Tinubu's emergence as the presidential candidate of our great party is a fitting and deserving reward for a man who has been in the trenches for democracy and good governance for decades now.

I have an unwavering belief that as a soldier of democracy who has seen it all, he will lead the APC to seamless victory next year. 

Rest assured that as you look back, you will find me matching with you 100 per cent to the threshold of victory. 

I heartily and warmly congratulate Asiwaju on this monumental milestone.

There is a lot of work to do in the political arena and we must begin immediately. 
I shall be communicating next steps. Emancipation is a collective feat. 
I thank you all for your support. You have shown me your hearts and your dreams. Together, We shall be a nation reborn! 

I want to especially thank my team of conscientious Nigerians; both the youth and those vast in wisdom, for their exemplary service and show of courage. I feel blessed to walk this path with your company. May the Almighty God bless the works of our hands. Amen.

Teachers most especially
6/10/22, 9:34 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): They don’t need to tell you their choice neither do you need to follow their choice. Same way no one is obligating you to reveal their choice

Just get your PVC. That’s their motive. Vote for anybody wey you like.
6/10/22, 9:35 AM - +234 814 235 8262: Some of them already used their platform to promote their candidate. Oju won mabo
6/10/22, 9:35 AM - +234 906 762 1398: The same way you did for PYO
6/10/22, 9:35 AM - +234 906 762 1398: Everyone get his or her own choice

6/10/22, 9:35 AM - +234 810 815 2940: That's not the point here

But I get your "party affiliate" point
6/10/22, 9:36 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Same way you are using your platform to promote your candidate 

They didn’t force it on you.

6/10/22, 9:45 AM - +234 705 594 3652: But you said we should stop dragging other people based on their choice. You are breaking your own rule O, how you want to vote someone who is clearly unhealthy and can't even lift his own flag due to what seems like a stroke amazes me.

6/10/22, 9:48 AM - +234 814 235 8262: Answer this
6/10/22, 9:48 AM - +234 810 815 2940: If bat was healthier, a bit younger and he was able to convince me how how he wants to move Nigeria out of this dilapidated state (abd not on the basis of "next in line") I may also be campaigning for him 

But it won't be based on ethnicity. 

Stop playing ethnic card to justify your choice
6/10/22, 9:48 AM - +234 705 594 3652: It is still being invasive. I am just giving you a subtle reminder because we too have got  an arsenal. 😇
6/10/22, 9:50 AM - +234 705 594 3652: I like your drift. Very intelligent take.
6/10/22, 9:51 AM - +234 810 815 2940: But they would have a free conscience of doing their bit

I may have ran myself into depression if it was Buhari I queued in the sun in imaweje town hall to vote in 2015.

My solace was the fact that, I was part of the very few who preempted our current disaster abd tried to put in a little action to prevent it

However, the deed was done. We can only do a retribution by voting in someone who is MOST credible in this current race.

2. How they rode to power
3. Current trend as regards economy
4. Capacity building
5. Youth servicing
6. Educational structure
7. Security
8. Bridging the Ethnicity gap.
6/10/22, 10:19 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Before I convince you, will you rather vote a Tinubu in place if Peter Obi?
6/10/22, 10:21 AM - +234 903 645 3146: Tinubu no get my vote..... So BAT is out of the equation for me.
6/10/22, 10:25 AM - +234 708 690 0451: @2347055943652 one day me and you will sit out.

I need to interrogate you.

Major Gen. Samuel Amadi

6/10/22, 10:27 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Before I convince you, the current realities if things were caused by these same geriatric septuagenarians. 

Look at the prices of gas, look at the cost of foodstuffs and commodities generally. Do you know how many businesses this administration have killed? 
ASUU is on strike. 
Power.
Security
Highest rate of unemployment.
Look at the wastages

What was Tinubu's trademark as the past Governor of Lagos State?

Do you want to replicate Lagos at the Federal Level?
6/10/22, 10:28 AM - +234 705 594 3652: In Lagos today the hegemony of Louts who collect levies from motorists and market women, where are these monies remitted to? 
What development have these monies been spent on? Do you want to replicate that at Federal level? Where we will pay tax and not get direct benefits of it? Why is Lagos heavily tolled?

It's the health
6/10/22, 10:31 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Till today, Tinubu and his cotravellers still denies that no youth was killed in Lekki even with video evidence. #Endsars 

Do you want to vote in someone who will send the military to go and wile out her youths because they were protesting against police brutality?
6/10/22, 10:35 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Few weeks ago Atiku deleted a post condemning the carnage that happened in Sokoto where a young student was stoned and eventually burnt to death because of blasphemy. He later poster in Hausa language on Facebook saying his social media handler posted it in error. 

Is that the coward you want to vote in as president! Someone who cannot openly condemn blasphemy in 2022?
6/10/22, 10:37 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Spot on, you can be 88, healthy and have a brain of Peter Obi.
6/10/22, 10:38 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Amadi, Politics concerns us all. You must vote o
6/10/22, 10:39 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Okay, between Atiku and Peter Obi, who is more competent, by antecedents. Let's leave their CVs out of this.
6/10/22, 10:40 AM - +234 708 690 0451: Voting is my right Sir. Sure I will vote
6/10/22, 10:42 AM - +234 903 645 3146: None of them.... But tell mi more about obi..

6/10/22, 10:50 AM - +234 705 594 3652: If you use MTN,, I will send you 500MB data and some Peter Obi's interviews from Arise, Channels and other media outlets. Watch his discussion on Platform a program by Pastor Poju Oyemade and anything I can lay my hands on. 

After that we can continue this conversation. But it is glaring that these archaic septuagenarians of BAT and Atiku brought us where we are today. I can bet no have not capacity to lead us out of this current pit we find ourselves. 

Think about moving the country to become a production-driven economy and not that of a consumer-driven economy, Obi has got the prowess.
6/10/22, 10:51 AM - +234 708 690 0451: Na this your septua something dey touch me oo. Abeg wetin e mean??
6/10/22, 10:53 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Sept in Latin means 7, so a septuagenarian is someone in his 70s.
6/10/22, 10:56 AM - +234 708 690 0451: Oh okkkkkk. Omor to go school good o.
Thank you my Oga
6/10/22, 10:57 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Amadi, I admire you. I know you will someday become a very top person in the military along with my traitor friend @Wahab.
6/10/22, 10:58 AM - +234 708 690 0451: Yes Sir!! Thank You Boss
6/10/22, 11:01 AM - +234 903 645 3146: Are you a candidate supporter or party supporter,

Reason for this question is that...... Will you still have this campaign energy for Obi if PDP gv him presidential ticket?
6/10/22, 11:04 AM - +234 703 446 8168: @2348164636464 


Obi will come third position!


By 2027, his electoral value might be diminished unless he journey back to the party with structure (Grassroot)
6/10/22, 11:05 AM - +234 903 645 3146: See as you scatter everything
6/10/22, 11:10 AM - +234 705 594 3652: I am clearly a candidate person based clearly on manifesto and competence since I started voting 15years ago. If PDP had given Peter Obi the ticket, I would have voted PDP. 

Even if Peter Obi moves to ABC party today I will still vote him there. Obi wanted to be the flag bearer for PDP but you cannot stay among wolves for too long especially at Federal Level. 

Someone like Seyi Makinde, any day he wants to run for any Federal office, I will support him fully because he is current, in tune with realities and highly competent.
6/10/22, 11:11 AM - +234 903 645 3146: I dey with you....
Misef na candidate i dey follow


I dey with obi
6/10/22, 11:11 AM - +234 903 645 3146: 💯✅💯
6/10/22, 11:12 AM - +234 816 463 6464: His third position is 💯 certain but the salient question is if he will be able to build structures across the country within the LP.....

Obi would have made APGA a regional party just like BAT made ACN prior before APC.....

I don't think he has the capacity to build such structure.
6/10/22, 11:13 AM - +234 813 948 8163: Big and bold third💯
6/10/22, 11:14 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Well, let's take it to the polls then. It is a process, as for the structure, I can bet you can never imagine what is about to come. 

PYO was a fine candidate who played to the gallery because babasope. A refined man like that seen sharing trader moni up and down and was quiet throughout the uselessness of this administration. 

When Obi became the flag bearer of APGA, they had no structure, today look at APGA, look at Peter Obi. 

Strategies with hard work win elections, not structure. Human beings like you and I are the structure.
6/10/22, 11:15 AM - +234 703 446 8168: I tagged you because I know you are a very sound person when it comes to discourse like this!


His first failure began with APGA.
If he made that party a regional one, he would have had a good ground to negotiate with any party today.

THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM & BAT lies there!

BAT’s ability to be solid as the only major opposition to the central govt gave him the ticket!
6/10/22, 11:15 AM - Iseyemi: Starred...
6/10/22, 11:16 AM - +234 703 446 8168: This same TRADERMONI was what your principal faulted and then talked about something of such when he needed to find a solution in an aspect related.

Let’s be practical, and realistic!
6/10/22, 11:17 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Furthermore, there is difference between being a politician and a administrator!

PYO & PO are not politicians in my books
6/10/22, 11:19 AM - +234 705 594 3652: TTradermon was not sustainable, it was dead on arrival, it was just free money. Build lasting policies, look at YouWin, trader money was just free money for vote buying. 

Point of correction, I have no principal! My office as a Citizen is bigger than that of the President! 

Peter Obi is to serve me and not the way around. It is the uselessness of our leadership style that made it the other way around.
6/10/22, 11:21 AM - +234 816 463 6464: I agreed with your last sentence i.e *"Human beings like you and I are the structure"*

Same thing I told @2347034468168 in our conversation earlier.....

But if I may ask, how is APGA as a party today? Even in the SE, has the party being able to do anything significant politically wise?
6/10/22, 11:21 AM - +234 703 446 8168: I know it died on arrival…not arguing that!

The “principal” word, my apologies.


However, he is coming 3rd.

Let us now see if he will be able to build a sustainable party throughout the country come 2027.
6/10/22, 11:21 AM - +234 705 594 3652: A party that drove Nigeria into the worst economic regression is what you are here pitching about? 

Elections will come and go, but we will all be here to suffer our collective decision, can't we even be wise enough to select the best of us to lead us?
6/10/22, 11:22 AM - +234 703 446 8168: The dude wasted APGA…

He is one who is known to chicken out at every point!

Why did he dump APGA for the PDP?

And when he was to dump PDP, he chose LP…what happened to the party that gave him the guber election?
6/10/22, 11:23 AM - +234 816 463 6464: BAT had guts in him 😂..... Baba don dey build since the AD days he even pursue the Afenifere group of the then AD to have his way.....

Tinubu na weray politician 😂
6/10/22, 11:23 AM - +234 705 594 3652: How did APC come about today? Building through coalition, so be calm. 

Be calm....except through voters intimidation and suppression but that's all we will be fighting against. It has already begun, but we will resist it!
6/10/22, 11:24 AM - +234 903 645 3146: Hmmm🤔🤔🤔
6/10/22, 11:24 AM - +234 705 594 3652: How has it transformed the lives of the people? How has it better the life of the average Nigerian?  It is not just about building structures, it is about building people and capacity.
6/10/22, 11:24 AM - +234 703 446 8168: This is what we are talking about!

PO was governor under an underdog party same as BAT!

PO left the underdog for the bigger CAT!

BAT stood with the underdog and made it the BIGGEST cat 🐈 of today!


One is a LEGENG, the other is just a CAST in the LEGENDARY movie
6/10/22, 11:24 AM - +234 816 463 6464: I don't see anything bad in the TRADERMONI scheme except for the ways it was executed.....

It's called STIMULUS and being practiced across the globe
6/10/22, 11:25 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Even PO who faulted it said something contrary again!

It’s sad I can’t fetch evidence
6/10/22, 11:26 AM - +234 816 463 6464: Thought you said you are not for the party but rather the candidate 😒
6/10/22, 11:26 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Countries are forming economic coalition we are here discussing trada moni! 😇🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/10/22, 11:26 AM - +234 903 645 3146: @2347055943652

Northerners nko about Peter Obi
6/10/22, 11:26 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Why did he not stay with his APGA to transform the lives of the people from his region?

Instead, he chickened out to CHILL WITH THE BIG BOYS - GREED!


Now he is the one taking y’all to destination ISRAEL, no!

Until he builds a structure around himself without chickening out at every point!

WIKE came after him as a governor and made his mark known!
6/10/22, 11:27 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Maybe you should go back and read the thread again for easier comprehension. 😇
6/10/22, 11:27 AM - +234 816 463 6464: He gats no gut plus a lirru bit of desperation (IMO😂)
6/10/22, 11:27 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Brother…he won’t get 10% of vote cast from there!

He will come 3rd with less than 6 million votes in total!

6/10/22, 11:28 AM - +234 703 446 8168: That desperation ehn!

What’s bad in the dude being a VP to AA again?

But NO, he wants to rule without a PLAN but TWITTER opinion polls!

Iranu
6/10/22, 11:28 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Have we ever had 50 million vote cast in total?

It has always been around 30/35 million votes!
6/10/22, 11:29 AM - +234 903 645 3146: Hmmm
6/10/22, 11:30 AM - +234 703 446 8168: APC will have around 15/16 million votes 

PDP will have 12/13 million votes

Others will have 7/8 million votes in total (PO, LP & TWITTER polls inclusive)

Bro, leave unrealistic discourse for the reality
6/10/22, 11:30 AM - +234 810 619 9957: This illustration deep
6/10/22, 11:30 AM - +234 705 594 3652: This current election is fragmented in such a way that the vote decides /swings in favour of anyone who is able to get both the new voters and the youths on their sides. 

I can bet the Northerners are voting their brothers and same for every other regions. 

And I like it that way because a winner will emerge from what I see as protest votes, that is if we are angry enough. Nobody is voting you because emi loan even if some people do, not everyone will.
6/10/22, 11:32 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Why did Tinubu not stick with his AD?
6/10/22, 11:33 AM - +234 703 446 8168: NO!

BAT will claim at least 50/60% of votes cast in the North with higher number cos he is winning the Kardashians (KANO, KATSINA, KADUNA).

He will almost tear SOKOTO into two with KWAKWANSO’s NNPP!

He will win the states APC have governors!

He will win the whole of SW!

Come close third in SE & SS!

Then emerge with 2/3 million votes!

Pin 📌 this!

We can use same energy wey we use vote pdp out in 2015 to also vote Apc out.....

Make we see another party structures and movement
6/10/22, 11:34 AM - +234 903 645 3146: Wey u see dat one.... Una sha no like peace
6/10/22, 11:34 AM - +234 705 594 3652: If you are being serious, should we always be the stooge of the Northerners? Do they have more capacity than their other counterparts? 

Is like asking a NOI to be Atiku's running mate.
6/10/22, 11:34 AM - +234 703 446 8168: His AD transformed to AC through some coalition, then ACN through another then APC which eventually is leading the country and the biggest political party in Africa!
6/10/22, 11:34 AM - +234 816 463 6464: There's nothing to go back to read.....

In one of your responses, you said if PO were to contest in PDP, you will vote him and even if he contest in ABC party you will still vote him because you're for the individual and not the party.....

Why then make reference to; *"A party that drove Nigeria into the worst economic regression is what you are here pitching about"* when you are more of the individual....

Let's focus on the candidate 🤌🏼
6/10/22, 11:34 AM - +234 807 434 7813: Dapo na goat
6/10/22, 11:34 AM - +234 703 446 8168: They have the capacity to decide anyone who emerges!

They do not have the capacity to rule well, I dunno!

But it is not about Notherners but the reality of Nigeria election!
6/10/22, 11:34 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I’m tired 🥱

6/10/22, 11:35 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Very good calculations, very good. Again it is not yet time. There will be defections, the Norther cult will leave their own person and vote A Tinubu.
6/10/22, 11:36 AM - +234 703 446 8168: They left theirs to vote an OBJ!

So, it’s nothing new!

Until there is something to disprove this in reality, YES!
6/10/22, 11:36 AM - +234 810 619 9957: Regarding voting from my own view:

The youths are only making noise on social media

1. Most dont have PVC
2. Most will not be in the area of their polling unit on the election day
3. Most are yet to pick up their PVC after even registering 
4. Some will make themselves available that day but wont be patient enough to wait.

5. The Northern youths will never team up with the south to vote against their own particularly SE.

Last last na still between PDP & APC Mr President go come from.
6/10/22, 11:37 AM - +234 705 594 3652: Well, I cannot help you comprehend what is glaring. 😇
6/10/22, 11:37 AM - +234 703 446 8168: would have been easier for your candidate if APC fields a Northerner!

Then the whole of SS/SE/SW & almost half of the North central would have chosen another candidate!
6/10/22, 11:37 AM - +234 816 463 6464: <Media omitted>
6/10/22, 11:38 AM - +234 703 446 8168: You forgot to tell them that most of these youths are in diaspora!

A certain PO will be president when the law of Nigeria permits voting in diaspora!
6/10/22, 11:38 AM - +234 903 645 3146: U n include street football
6/10/22, 11:39 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Or you can not help yourself comprehend:


1. You saying you would vote PO if he were in any part and then switching to say…

2. “A party that dragged us into the worst economy”

How is it difficult to understand that you have switched from blaming or supporting a candidate to attacking a party?

Goalpost is being shifted and tilted multiple times
6/10/22, 11:41 AM - +234 705 594 3652: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

6/10/22, 11:42 AM - +234 705 594 3652: You would rather vote a Parkinson-riddled candidate 🤣🤣🤣. I see where the problem is 😇. 

Because we will all be here 😇
6/10/22, 11:43 AM - +234 903 645 3146: 😁😆😁
6/10/22, 11:43 AM - Akotech: 9. Healthy status 
10. Societal empathy
6/10/22, 11:44 AM - +234 703 446 8168: With BIG brain to a fit candidate (physically) with SHAKY ideologies!

Somebody who saved money without development!

Abeg, na the money inside coffers of the state will make the state a better place to live?

Unrealistic radarada and he still left Anambra state a trenches 😂
6/10/22, 11:45 AM - +234 703 446 8168: In class now
6/10/22, 11:45 AM - +234 705 594 3652: No please the youth of Nigeria would rather vote a Parkinson ridden candidate then come back few years later to whine about how they do not have a job.  😇😇🤣🤣🤣🤣. Very what, very good.

Let's replicate that at Federal level, sebi you too will join me and Reliable surz to eat Cassava, Maize, Agbado and yam in the Army.
6/10/22, 11:49 AM - +234 903 645 3146: 😁😆😁

Abi @2349036453146 has he answered your question
6/10/22, 11:52 AM - +234 703 446 8168: And their slums can bring a thousand possibilities of wealth compared to the government house of ANAMBRA state!
6/10/22, 11:53 AM - +234 816 463 6464: The same slum people from PO glorified Anambra state are running to

Sell your candidate to us if you have the guts @2347055943652
6/10/22, 11:54 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Weray ni Arakunrin yii!

6/10/22, 11:54 AM - +234 705 594 3652: I am not selling anything!  I am just letting you know how our collective bad decisions will hunt us. 

Don't forget we have 8years to eat Agbado, Yam, Cassava and maize.

The deaths, the religious differences and carnage waiting to happen from a bad decision.

Think am well 😇
6/10/22, 11:56 AM - +234 813 948 8163: Hmmm
6/10/22, 11:57 AM - +234 816 463 6464: I have my reservations for BAT
I am not a fan of AA
And here I am considering PO and he couldn't help out with reasons to vote him rather he's using English to test my intelligence...

O wrong oooo @2347055943652
6/10/22, 11:57 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Make we chop am!

At least I know what I want to eat…let your candidate promise me fried rice fess 😂 

Until then.
6/10/22, 11:58 AM - +234 816 463 6464: That's why Figo and myself in particular is asking you WHY Peter Obi
6/10/22, 11:59 AM - +234 703 446 8168: @2348164636464 

This is the what we were discussing …


Everyone of them will blame all past governments and possible candidates but no concrete reason to vote his aspirant!

Just vibes and in sha Allah
6/10/22, 11:59 AM - +234 903 645 3146: Ajeh
6/10/22, 12:00 PM - +234 703 446 8168: I had this discussion with @2348106199957 


Why should I vote him?

As in why??

But ironi, @2348164636464 don’t be fooled, @2349036453146 already left you in agreement to PO without reason! He jumped on the bandwagon! 😂
6/10/22, 12:00 PM - +234 903 645 3146: 😁😆😁

Yes BAT might be suffering from dementia due to whatever reasons but we can still be assured he will have gladiators managing key resources in the nation.
6/10/22, 12:02 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Same thing the APC folks are doing....

In few months time, they will all come out with campaigns that will show how worse Bubu has taken us 🤦🏻‍♂️

Kuku kill me…

Me ooo, it BAT until proven otherwise!

Based on all conversations so far and my personal discussion with you…I have been convinced and not confused that PO does not only lack a party with structure, his followers lack structure to market him too.
6/10/22, 12:08 PM - +234 810 206 9268: Your own no go spoil
6/10/22, 12:08 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Aameen!

6/10/22, 12:09 PM - +234 810 206 9268: The earlier this people learn that your economic intellect will amount to nothing without sound political stamina the better
6/10/22, 12:11 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Do people need to even market candidates to you before deciding on who to votes?

If you can't check out the candidates yourself and make a decision that would keep your mind at peace regardless of the outcome through the next tenure, then you are part of the problem
6/10/22, 12:12 PM - +234 817 275 8620: 💯
6/10/22, 12:12 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Abeg under which party is Moghalu contesting bayii... He is another sane candidate that I have been eyeing 

Although, I still have reservations for BAT though and I am still a slip-carrying member of the APC 🥶
6/10/22, 12:12 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Make dem kuku cancel campaign!

Your Royal EYEness!
6/10/22, 12:13 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Youths who don't have jobs or are underemployed want me to sell them a candidate. If I still need to sell a candidate to you at this age then you clearly have a problem.
6/10/22, 12:13 PM - +234 810 815 2940: He didn't win primaries
6/10/22, 12:14 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Our level of research dey different regardless of how we would want to sound smart.....

Discussions like this will open ones eyes to what some of us don't know...
6/10/22, 12:16 PM - +234 810 206 9268: Me I sha know that a candidate that crumbles under in house pressure is not fit to manage a country
6/10/22, 12:16 PM - +234 816 463 6464: You are back with this your thought process 😂😂😂😂😂

Always come back with some emotions to narrow down your point
6/10/22, 12:16 PM - +234 703 446 8168: 1. I’m not one of the “jobless youths.” I have job and I’m voting my employer in PDP!

2. You can do yourself some good not to demarket another candidate if you’re not marketing yours!

3. Focus on yourself more and respect our individual opinions as we respected yours!

4. Try to stop shifting goalposts cos you started by selling him to other at the expense of others!

Until the four (4) above are satisfied, then you don’t have a problem either!
6/10/22, 12:16 PM - +234 816 463 6464: So he is staying back in ADC
6/10/22, 12:16 PM - +234 705 594 3652: That's being warped and distorted. When you are not an handicap 🤣🤣
6/10/22, 12:16 PM - +234 703 446 8168: He will pick up senatorial or House of Rep forms of APGA soon..make we see

God bless you!
✌️
6/10/22, 12:22 PM - +234 810 815 2940: This is fact!

However the stated above is based on this age bracket and intellectual level

Chosing a candidate based on what people are saying Abt that candidate will only clout your judgement of the candidate.

P.S.: That's why we ended up with Buhari

We ended up with BUHARI cos we don’t have a certain PO somewhere!

A certain PO would have salvaged the situation in 2019.

6/10/22, 12:25 PM - +234 705 594 3652: It would have salvaged it in 2019 but not in 2023. Okay.....
6/10/22, 12:25 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Maybe do Python. 😇
6/10/22, 12:25 PM - +234 810 619 9957: How do u mean PO was alongside AA in 2019
6/10/22, 12:25 PM - +234 705 594 3652: 🙏
6/10/22, 12:26 PM - +234 810 815 2940: But now that you have the PO, you noted he has no structure 🤣

Face it, the game is the game, let's play it wholeheartedly
6/10/22, 12:26 PM - +234 703 446 8168: In 2023, we will eventually be stuck with AA or BAT again!

2 things will now happen…

• if either of the winners do anyhow, we will hope for a better nation under another person

• If PO is now solid enough to hold LP nicely, he will win come 2027
6/10/22, 12:26 PM - +234 703 446 8168: @2348108152940 

Your answer
6/10/22, 12:27 PM - +234 816 463 6464: More reason I said "I have my reservations for him"

BAT and AA looks too desperate for the Presidency as far as I am concerned... Just like Buhari in 2015

Although I campaign for Bubu 😏
6/10/22, 12:27 PM - +234 903 645 3146: Haaa
2027 lonloon
6/10/22, 12:27 PM - +234 703 446 8168: “If we had a certain PO” doesn’t mean PO gangan..I meant a third option!

@2348106199957, what can VP do differently?

VPs na gbewudani nAh
6/10/22, 12:27 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Who is we? You and your batistuta will be stuck with both AA and bat. 

When it is not Afishe!
6/10/22, 12:28 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Lol abeg no kill me
6/10/22, 12:28 PM - +234 705 594 3652: No 2031 actually...thats how election cycle works in Nigeria, except someone kicks the bucket 😇
6/10/22, 12:28 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Vote your PO, I’m telling you emphatically that he won’t emerge!

You and I will have AA or BAT as Nigeria president come 2023 😂
6/10/22, 12:28 PM - +234 903 645 3146: Happy Birthday Ldr *Odedeyi Seyi*
6/10/22, 12:28 PM - +234 705 594 3652: In a nut shell we are eating Yam, Agbado, Maize and Cassava till 2031
6/10/22, 12:29 PM - +234 810 815 2940: That's exactly what I said

We have a "PO" now but we will still not go to that option (@least you, based on what you have said here)

So it's not different now, it wasn't different in 2015
6/10/22, 12:30 PM - +234 703 446 8168: GEJ was sent packing after 4 years by a party with structure!


2023-2027 is 4 years, PO should be able to build and negotiate that structure in this time!

If he fails again, then he is one loved OYE WUMI individual that Nigeria will never have as President
6/10/22, 12:30 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Again, President is for all, candidates aren't for all. We will both be affected by our common decision till 2031.
6/10/22, 12:30 PM - +234 810 619 9957: So in all this we are stuck with either BAT or AA. What do we stand to get from them both leading us or who as better plans
6/10/22, 12:30 PM - +234 705 594 3652: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/10/22, 12:31 PM - +234 816 463 6464: You have a choice of voting PO and live in peace till 2027 at least
6/10/22, 12:31 PM - +234 705 594 3652: You think bat and aa will ease off power like GEJ? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/10/22, 12:31 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Are u saying ur vote is for PO?
6/10/22, 12:31 PM - +234 703 446 8168: That’s cos I’m realistic…I know he can’t emerge next year!

Let him start building from 2023 till 2027 (4 years)…iya alata dey vote pass us (youths) for this Nigeria.

Btw now and 4 years, let’s have youths inclusiveness as card carriers of LP of PO.

Then we will be more serious about this
6/10/22, 12:32 PM - +234 705 594 3652: No need please, on bat we stand
6/10/22, 12:33 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Then 2027 is not too far 😂 

It took BAT many decades to get here!

It took Atiku 3 decades (since 1992) to get here

So, 8 years is not too far PO 😂
6/10/22, 12:33 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Hmmm with this analysis is as good as saying if he wanted that structure he ought to have started long ago rather than jumping party
6/10/22, 12:33 PM - +234 703 446 8168: How is that your problem and he chose not to have peace 😂
6/10/22, 12:33 PM - +234 705 594 3652: *PUBLIC INFORMATION* 

INEC officials will be in Iyana Ejigbo market on Monday, 13/06/2022  by 9am for PVC fresh registration, change of polling unit, replacement of lost or damaged card e.t.c

He should earn it!


Dude has done nothing to earn the office but English and how he saved money without a single development in Anambra that he wanted to use!

He left Anambra a trenches he met it!

6/10/22, 12:36 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Not a rationale behind it…


I dunno why I should PO yet…I have tried to check but nothing concrete!

Give me 5 good reasons (his antecedents)why I should vote him…if convincing enough, I swear to God I will vote him! I wil even snap my ballot to show you here!

I discussed this with @2348164636464 few days ago!
6/10/22, 12:36 PM - +234 705 594 3652: The video is everywhere. That's what you get from a mega city run by Bat Parkinson

6/10/22, 12:37 PM - +234 705 594 3652: It happened during GEJ 😇
6/10/22, 12:37 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Please win a soul for PO!

Now I’m opened to be convinced!


Please for God’s sake … win the heart of a voter!


This offer is LIMITED!
6/10/22, 12:38 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Really didnt know o

6/10/22, 12:39 PM - +234 703 446 8168: What difference does it make from the state of a renowned Economist whose kinsmen murdered INEC officials distributing PVC in cold blood?


You forgot so soon?
6/10/22, 12:39 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Nothing for Peter Obi abeg
6/10/22, 12:39 PM - +234 705 594 3652: It did, why do you think the oba of lagos island said igbos will be thrown into the lagoon.
6/10/22, 12:39 PM - +234 816 463 6464: I am still indifference as at now
6/10/22, 12:39 PM - +234 703 446 8168: @2348164636464 
@2348108152940 
@2348106199957 


Now you see, even @2347055943652 does not know why he is voting PO!

He jumped on a bandwagon!
6/10/22, 12:40 PM - +234 810 619 9957: What goes around comes around abeg make we no dey stress ourselves over this matter na game of tic for tat
6/10/22, 12:40 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Exactly

That's how everybody will be "realistic" too and not join in the structure building

It has always been like that, it will continue
Nothing will change, not now, not 2027, not 2031
6/10/22, 12:40 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Hmmm

6/10/22, 12:42 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Please watch the words brother!

You can be civil and not use those words!

Where is the ‘mutual respect’ in civil conversation?
6/10/22, 12:42 PM - +234 705 594 3652: My P U is in the core of Lagos Island, Igbos were not even allowed to exercise there franchise. It happened in Okota where voters were attacked.
6/10/22, 12:43 PM - +234 810 619 9957: You might have to rephrase this statement or take it back

6/10/22, 12:44 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Again comprehension issue, don't misconstrue and allow emotions. . I said a person must be disillusioned or handicapped for me to sell Peter Obi. Not you na.

If you could just go back up there and see the pronoun, “you” and how it was deployed…

then maybe this will go on better.

And your entry in the quoted message of yours here doesn’t show respect even for someone who is younger than you!


Watch your words closely brother!
6/10/22, 12:46 PM - +234 705 594 3652: I get you, I have paraphrased.

That we all have level playground without disparity to converse is enough 

But you now acting out of manner because you’re trying to make a point is rather offensive. So I’m saying don’t insult our elders all in the same of trying to made a point.

The amount of hate spilled and bigotry even from established folks today alone is sickening.

Apologising to him is the least thing to do if I have erred. My message there is being taken out of context. 

Subjecting this to all of these is actually being emotional. Can you please point out where I ascribed those words to him in person.

While choosing your presidential candidate, remember:

1. Lekki tole gate
2. Dollar rate to Naira
3. Sponsors of Bandits
4. Negotiators with bandits/herdsmen
5. The raid on judges 
6. The killings going on in the North East
7. The killings in the Niger Delta
8. Cost of Kerosene
9. The cost of Diesel
10. The cost of petrol
11. Nigeria is still in darkness no light
12. Traveling by road, rail, flight is at your own risk
13. End SARS and those who concealed Nigerians food in warehouses Because of elections

14. All the fake promises
15. Nigeria is the world poverty capital even though we the 7th oil producing nation

16. Your heroes are locked up simply because they demand justice and equity

19. As developed as France is, a 39year old youths took over power

20. The school your children are attending has no roof and is always flooded

21. The previous RULERS  had no ideas on how to govern or move the country forward

22.  we were once united, irrespective of religion or ethnic background until we made the greatest mistake of our lives

23.  the N5000, N10,000 you take to vote a thief will hunt your generation

24. Millions are looking for food to eat

25. Remember ASUU is still on strike, politicians children are schooling abroad

26. Some politicians take governance as their family business, say no to such people.

27. to  use you brain, don't let any man control your destiny. We are all equal before God.

28. Politicians that became rich overnight stole our common wealth. They killed, destroyed and maim to attain that position. They are not fit to be there. They are evil with blood stains on their names. God's judgement is waiting for them.

It is not about party but the individual that God has brought to effect the true change we all desire. Don't be deceived by party politics, we must take back our country. Be wise.

He who has ears, let him hear.

What exactly is happening in the APC from the North... The defection ever since the Presidential primary doesn't seems normal
6/11/22, 3:14 PM - +234 813 288 6674: I want the party to go into extinction
6/11/22, 3:57 PM - +234 816 463 6464: The momentum PO is building is massive and scary for the 2 most popular parties.....

Y'all followers might want to disagree but your party Leaders can see and attest to it especially the PDP.....

This 3rd force is entirely different 📌
6/11/22, 3:58 PM - +234 809 866 4771: That's wat u all said before the primary was held at eagle square

Boss Mustapha would have been another option but he is not politically strong in this dispensation

6/11/22, 4:38 PM - +234 817 014 8364: Bros calm down..

Mustapha is ok and strong. Hes not been considered because he's ACN bloc.

We also have dalung aside dogara.

When considering religion, dem de consider the bloc the VP is coming from
6/11/22, 4:38 PM - +234 816 463 6464: The North will be happy bro..... Although PDP will see something to campaign with (Propaganda sturv) but it will be a difficult contest to win for them
6/11/22, 4:39 PM - +234 817 014 8364: Nothing will happen...

Na politics, na wetin favor party dem go do.

Una go Jes shout, dats my point.

Since dey have fulfilled regional south n north tin
6/11/22, 4:42 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Same religion ticket doesn’t matter for Presidency in a country divided over religion and ethnicity like the Nigeria we have now. 

Okay. 🤣
6/11/22, 4:43 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Okay
6/11/22, 4:43 PM - +234 817 014 8364: It doesn't matter if e no favor party.

If na by DAT one. PDP no go give atiku ticket
6/11/22, 4:43 PM - +234 906 762 1398: Agreed 📌

6/11/22, 4:45 PM - +234 810 619 9957: At this stage religion shouldnt be our problem but credibility, good governance and accountability. Speaker HOR is a muslim alongside is deputy, Kaduna is divided into Northern & Southern: the North side is dominated by Muslims while the south is dominated by Christians. The Gov of Kaduna is a muslim alongside is deputy and there was no problem. Apc as 17/19 Govs if am not mistaken only two are Christians Walahi Northerns will not vote their fellow kinsman that is a Christians. 

There is going to be a serious issue of Vice President because it matters now and the whole country is interested in how its gonna play out

We should look out for credibility but should vote Tinubu cos Yoruba lokan 

Awon oni yeye
6/11/22, 4:46 PM - +234 817 014 8364: Who said e no matter.

Always read to understand to react.

My point..

It only matters if d political party see a need for it not d masses.

If the ticket no go favor party, dey will not do it to please Una opposition or people.

I entered d arguments when u said na wetin una (PDP) de wait for.
6/11/22, 4:47 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Okay

6/11/22, 4:49 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Because it's APC then religion shouldn't be an issue 

Nice comment sir 👏🏻
6/11/22, 4:50 PM - +234 903 645 3146: In everything we do in life, make we sha get money.
6/11/22, 4:50 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Take it or leave it, Religion play a big role in our Political Space.....

if Atiku  decides  to use muslim as his running mate or  If Peter obi also uses a Christians as his running mate will that also be a problem
6/11/22, 4:52 PM - +234 817 014 8364: If APC as a party see that irrespective of religion, a strong candidate from the north is all that is needed to win the election, they would go for it. 

Then they would pacify southern bloc or Christian with a senate presidency (a christian SP) kojubelo.

A christian SSG. Everything as a price.
6/11/22, 4:52 PM - +234 903 645 3146: Aswear... U dey follow

6/11/22, 4:56 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Dogara or boss mustapha thats all. Dogara can still pull vote dont know abt Boss.

If Apc get it wrong with Vp walahi Atiku go get sympathy vote in addition to his normal vote.
6/11/22, 4:57 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I was even expecting maybe someone will mention MKO Abiola time o

6/11/22, 4:58 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Religion and ethnicity is not a thing in Nigeria politics
Make Tinubu chose a Muslim from south west na

Make Atiku carry northern Muslim like Tambuwal na

Make Obi carry Christian Southerner na
6/11/22, 4:58 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): But it was democracy

50% done already 😂🤣

Why APC no use Tinubu in 2015?
6/11/22, 5:01 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Nobody is disputing this.... It's all the party decision but we coming out now to sound as if Religion has not been part of our polity is what I don't seems to understand.... (I quite understand you perfectly)

However if it were to be the other way round, the APC won't allow us here word till the PDP conform to the same formation.....
6/11/22, 5:01 PM - +234 903 645 3146: He couldn't can
6/11/22, 5:02 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): In the name of God, they will go ahead with that Muslim Muslim
6/11/22, 5:02 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Shebi PDP go just shout Nani

6/11/22, 5:10 PM - +234 810 619 9957: The film wey dey go down for PVC registration for TBS no be small.  omo for south people plenty wey no get PVC
6/11/22, 5:10 PM - +234 816 463 6464: And you are from which state sir
6/11/22, 5:10 PM - +234 816 463 6464: PO is coming
Peter is better
6/11/22, 5:11 PM - +234 810 619 9957: The question is dis who is gonna be Peter oni running mate first?
6/11/22, 5:11 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Yes

But It's too late gor that
6/11/22, 5:11 PM - +234 903 645 3146: From Eleyi State
6/11/22, 5:11 PM - +234 810 815 2940: For
6/11/22, 5:11 PM - +234 903 645 3146: Hmm
6/11/22, 5:11 PM - +234 705 594 3652: I think his running mate will most likely be a woman from the North. However, I hope @Kwankwaso will make that call. 

That said, Peter obi just needs to maintain the 25percent and a good number of votes from the Northern Part of Nigeria.
6/11/22, 5:12 PM - +234 816 463 6464: For Peter Obi, it won't matter.....

Trust me when I say it won't matter 😜
6/11/22, 5:12 PM - +234 903 645 3146: Kwanka wah.....
6/11/22, 5:12 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Kwan what....

Is this playing 😄

Well nothing is impossible though
6/11/22, 5:13 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Hmmm bro i swear na for social media PO get strength. For that at TBS wey me i know if i hear say wetin dey go down for there Mc olumo, BAT, Kudeti no know make i break. Pvc registration for Lagos Island baba no worry Na PDP and More APC dey register o
6/11/22, 5:13 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Eleyi state is not politically a strong state at the moment hence your recommendation is DENIED
6/11/22, 5:14 PM - +234 810 619 9957: True sha
6/11/22, 5:15 PM - +234 705 594 3652: You need a coalition, you need all the help you can get to push your luck in the North. 

But I bet Peter Obi and his team are looking much more into that. 

Let's keep registering and getting our PVCs as INEC is most likely going to extend timeline. 

There is already a drive and I want to believe the Youths Needs Their Country Back!
6/11/22, 5:15 PM - +234 810 619 9957: So u feel the way Buhari was voted for in 2015 the same thing will come to play for PO in 2023?
6/11/22, 5:15 PM - +234 816 463 6464: I won't argue this with you because you never believed anything positive will come from the angle.....

So I will allow you to keep saying na SM Peter Obi get strength if it makes you feel better ☺️
6/11/22, 5:16 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Yes.

6/11/22, 5:17 PM - +234 816 463 6464: I can't agree with you less but not everyone will see it
6/11/22, 5:17 PM - +234 810 619 9957: <Media omitted>
6/11/22, 5:19 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Peter Obi needs the required 25Percent in the South West. The South South and South East will most likely go in PO's favour so the main battle is getting enough numbers from the North(this is where the contribution of the VP) so whoever PO is considering needs to pull some weight in the North where Atiku, BAT and Kwankwaso hold sway.
6/11/22, 5:20 PM - +234 816 463 6464: ENDSARS movement started with less than 10 people and it shut down the country for 2 weeks....

Guess where the movement started from......

The fight against Police Brutality championed by Segalinks before the ENDSARS movement started from where again.....

The Youths are awakening and the result will be out soon.... It might not necessarily be for PO winning but a momentum is being built....
6/11/22, 5:21 PM - +234 810 619 9957: And who is that person that can pull that vote for PO that is ready to decamp to Labour Party coz i know Labour Party dont have that person in their party
6/11/22, 5:21 PM - +234 705 594 3652: I am sure the Team are already looking for all the necessary help and permutations and consultations. 

It is going to be a long ride, but as it stands it is no longer a two man horse race as usual.
6/11/22, 5:22 PM - +234 705 594 3652: I beg to disagree, Segalink never championed the END SARS movement, far from it. As he stands he remains one of the problems of the ENDSARS movement considering some outburst and recent comments. 

Did he contribute...Yes
Did he champion...No
6/11/22, 5:23 PM - +234 816 463 6464: You're busy expecting those that will decamp 😂

You're yet to see what PO is about to build
6/11/22, 5:23 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Did you read "before the ENDSARS movement" 😒
6/11/22, 5:24 PM - +234 810 619 9957: I agree with u.

Why did PO leave PDP for LP?

Most SE delegates voted for Atiku.

Most SE delegates voted for BAT leaving their fellow kinsman even Okorocha didnt get a single vote.

With this i dont agree the SE is for PO
6/11/22, 5:24 PM - +234 705 594 3652: APC, PDP, LP, NNPP all are currently in dilemma about their running mates. Atiku will most likely come to SS/SE, PO will most likely go North. So let's see how it goes.
6/11/22, 5:25 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Alright lets see how its goes 👍
6/11/22, 5:26 PM - +234 810 619 9957: I cant wait to see What PO will build like u said
6/11/22, 5:26 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Again, Segalink did not "champion" the End SARS movement.
6/11/22, 5:26 PM - +234 903 645 3146: 🤔🤔🤔
6/11/22, 5:27 PM - +234 705 594 3652: For sure, my main joy that it is no longer business as usual. Everyone needs to guard their territory and lunch out for more in the respective "enemy's camp.
6/11/22, 5:27 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Delegates are different from real voters when election comes.....

Delegates are not moved by your competence

So how do you compare delegates that are less than 5k in both parties to real voters running into millions
6/11/22, 5:27 PM - +234 903 645 3146: But if AA rumored running mate na true..... Ayiiiii..... Atiku go be president o
6/11/22, 5:28 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Who please Umahi?
6/11/22, 5:28 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Okowa?

6/11/22, 5:29 PM - +234 816 463 6464: I never said he championed it na 😂

Campaign against Police Brutality didn't start with ENDSARS movement na

*Segalinks has been there for the people when it comes to Police issue before Endsars and it started from same SM.....*

Do you get it now or I still need to explain to you further 😒
6/11/22, 5:29 PM - +234 813 948 8163: The question is, shey Hausa are ready to listen to anything like PO

What constitutes the structure
6/11/22, 5:32 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Human beings are the people who vote, human beings are the structures,  up north people vote on religious sentiments, politician who appeal to them, those who they respect. However, a running mate/VP will address these issues.

6/11/22, 5:36 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Saint 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣, thing is that man is detailed to it's teeth. 

A win-win if he sees a saint, if not he should shop for someone who shares the same ideology in moving the nation away from it's current state.
6/11/22, 5:36 PM - +234 813 948 8163: Now this is what I mean.

In a state like Oyo, if a party like SDP is having a credible candidate, such candidate despite his credibility might still loose out due to party coming from.
The bitter truth is that on Election, majority of people that go out there to vote are party people and those that party people are able to convince to pool.

How many dey go vote base on say I like this man
6/11/22, 5:36 PM - +234 810 619 9957: You are saying we cant compre delegates with the real voters that i agree but am saying the in house delegates have their numbers in the real election. Voters that will listen to them
6/11/22, 5:40 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Candidates influence votes, I will give examples

Obi -Apga unseat a strong candidate from PDP
Mimiko - Ondo unseat Agagu from I think PDP
FUNSHO WILLIAMS would have done it in Lagos but .....we all know how it ended. 

Don't forget that in Presidential election you win when you get 25percent in some areas and also polling higher votes in some areas.
6/11/22, 5:43 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Let me give another instance, do you think Rochas Okorocha being from the core SE will pull this weight as PO? Even if runs under APC, PDP or the strongest political party in the East?
6/11/22, 5:49 PM - +234 815 526 0742: His mandate was stolen
6/11/22, 5:50 PM - +234 813 948 8163: Hmmm
6/11/22, 5:59 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Have you ever being approached by any delegate prior to any general election before?
6/11/22, 6:00 PM - +234 705 594 3652: LAGOS STATE is the most indebted States with 16% of total States' domestic indebtedness.

SOUTH WEST is Nigeria's most indebted zone with 30% of total zones' indebtedness.

LAGOS STATE debt is 53% of SOUTH WEST domestic debt.

SOUTH EAST is the least indebted zone.

He used his influence as a conduit to ruin the state(s) and replicating that is counterproductive in the real scheme of things.

That's what some people want to replicate at Federal Level.
6/11/22, 6:09 PM - +234 816 463 6464: If not for my 💯 attention to this year Primary Election, I have never for once heard about Delegate influencing election.....

In all the election I have participated in, I voted and campaigned for votes based on my conviction and not because one delegate told me to and I can say same for others that I know....

Back to you discourse, delegates are just an instrument used by politicians to have their way during primary elections..... 

Take APC Ona-Ara and Oyo North Senatorial District as a case study... The incumbents in both cases ensured that the people's choice didn't emerge by changing the delegates list (I stand to be corrected)

So whatever functions ascribed to Delegates is only useful doing internal party politics...

6/11/22, 7:53 PM - +234 811 852 9190: *HOW ELECTION IS RIGGED!!!* 

📢📢📢📢🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬

One of The biggest problems we have are those of you who think that whether or not they vote, the election will be rigged. Those who think our votes don’t count.
Yesterday, someone told me “Baba voting no go solve anything, our votes no Dey count, person wey go win go win”…. That’s a lie, a big lie from the pit of hell. 
Our votes Dey count, and person wey go win fit no we if we no vote.

Rigging is not as easy as we make it seem, it’s a game of numbers… permutations and combinations for those that know maths.

Ok lemme explain it in clearer ways.
Let’s say a particular polling unit has 800 registered voters; on Election Day, 800 ballot papers will be sent to that polling unit because it is expected that 800 people will show up to vote.

Now if on the day of the election, only 150 people come out to vote, and out of the 150, 127 people vote for LP and and 20 people for PDP then 3 people vote for APGA, it means there will be about 650 ballot papers unused.

When rigging starts, one person can sit one place and thumbprint the remaining 650 ballot papers in favour of APC and when the result is announced, APC will emerge the winner of that particular polling unit.
That is how Rigging is done.

But imagine If this same polling unit with 800 registered voters have 750 people who came out to vote, and 650 vote LP, 71 people vote PDP and 29 People vote APGA, when APC wants to rig the election, they will have only 50 ballot papers to work with and even if the thumbprint all 50 in favour of APC, the outcome of the election will not be affected.

That is how rigging works.

Truth is whether you decide to vote or not, a decision will be taken for you, and a vote will be cast in your name. And chances are that it will be in favour of someone who will enslave you and keep you in Pepertual suffering.
So why not get your PVC and come out to vote, at least you’ll be sure that the vote casted in your name was in favour of someone you would have Chosen.

Nigeria is on the brink of wreakage, and 2023 is our chance at getting it right. If we miss it in 2023, our next chance will be in 2031 and I’m not sure we can afford that.

 *So, I beg you in the name of whatever you hold sacred. GET YOUR PVC AND GET READY TO COME AND VOTE!!!*..

6/12/22, 8:23 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Very Urgent Press Release

Comrade Mashood Erubami rejects the purported PRIMARY ELECTION in Egbeda ONA Ara Federal Constituency !

Comrade Mashood  Erubam has briefed His Solicitors to head fir court to remedy the fraudulent malpractices that were embedded in the primary election that was concocted by the Incumbent House of Representatives Candidate in Egbeda ONA Ara Federal Constituency on Thursday 2nd June, 2022 at the Party's Secretariat, Segelu Area, on New Ife Road Ibadan.

According to Comrade' Mashood Erubami  " for upward of four times, the arranged primaries failed to hold as a result of lack of transparency in the arrangement for the primaries, refusal to release the list of delegates before the primary even on the purported election day not withstanding the insistence of Aspirants to have access to the list ! 
All these in the presence of invited Stakeholders, like the Police, Civil Defence Corps, INEC and the DSS from the two local Government Council Areas.

Comrade Mashood Erubami a Development Finance Expert and Human Rights Activist frowned at the manner in which the purported Primary election was conducted with fake votes allocated to him when he was not party to the election because no list of Delegates was made available to him before the election and he could not canvass for delegates votes.Also, he could not secure the support of unknown Delegates before the Primary election and even on the purported election day.

To our constanation, a video that went veril reported that an election held and that figures of votes were allocated to me and my co- Contestant when we were not given the list of delegates that should have been mobilized to vote for us ! Yet the incumbent was declared a winner in a primary election that never held with us!

 The hidding of Delegate list was not the issue in the recently concluded Presidential Prinary held in Abuja, Delegates list was released some days to the primary and Adpirants went out to address the delegates and canvassed for their votes hence the votingd on the primary Election days wee peaceful, free and fair. The person declared to have won did on the popular votes of the delegates because, the National leadership made the lists of delegates available and presidential aspirants were able to see and interact with the delegates before presidential primary election exercise.  Erubami queried, why the Delegate list in  Egbeda ONA Ara Federal Constituency was not released ? Which list was then used to conduct the so called election from where the incumbent Akin Alabis emerged a winner ? 

He had for these reasons rejected the votes allocated to him and the totality of the  election processes for reasons of substantial non compliance with the party's directives, guidelines and provisions of the electoral Act.

Comrade Erubami, who was the former head of National election Observation Group in Nigeria and first Executive CHAIRMAN of the West Africa Election Observation Network, ( WAEON) decided to fight for his Democratic Rights in the Court of law, saying, if his rights could be this infringed and he could not rise to use  his rights of recourse to law, Ordinary Nigerians will not benefit from the rule of law !
Apart from his readiness to engage Teams of Lawyers to fight the inpunities in the election before a competent Court of law, he said, he will also challenge the submission of the names of the so-called Winner in the improper election Mr Akin Alabi, through the Independent National Electoral Commission, ( INEC) given the position that the Election Management Commission had stressed the facts that "Only the name of a Candidate that emerged through a democratically conducted primaries can be submitted to it. 

For the Purposes of Emphasis, INEC had warned that : " Only names of candidates that emerged from democratic primaries as provided by Sec. 84 of the Electoral Act 2022 shall be submitted" 

He claimed he shall rely on this to fight for his Democratic Rights.

Comrade Mashood Erubami affirmed that having exhausted all the Channels of Complaints and Appeals in the Party through the Appeal Panel set up by the Party and through direct Petition to the National Secretary of the party with copies to the Legal Department of the party in Abuja without reprieve,  The Best possible next line of action was to head for the Court of Law against the outcome of the “purported” party’s primaries, “assumed” to have taken place in the federal constituency. 

This he believed will halt the determination of certain  political infidels who are determined to halt the laws from ruling through turning the Party's directives and regulations upside down.

6/12/22, 8:29 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): The choice of Akinwumi Ambode as Governor Tunde Fashola's successor was because of the growing sentiment that only Muslims had been governing Lagos State, back to back- since the return of civil rule in 1999.

Governor Sanwo-Olu was brought in to complete the second term tenure of Ambode which he could not get when he was denied the second term ticket of the APC. Even as recent as some weeks back, Sanwo-Olu might have been denied a second term. All the people that were being touted to replace him were Muslims. That's a cosmopolitan state. 

With the hurricane popularity of Candidate Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, why did not he allow himself to be used as a guinea pig for the Muslim-Muslim ticket? Why did the likes of Saraki, Fayemi and others speak against it and ensured it did not happen? 

Buhari with his popularity and the forces that coalesced to form the APC would have lost that election in 2015 resoundingly if he had chosen a Muslim deputy. 
 
Ordinarily, a Christian from the south ought to succeed President Buhari, who is a Muslim, because that's the tradition and convention in a country where the populations of the two religions are almost at par. This is so to avert the possibility of one religion dominating the other. 

But no one is even talking about the faith of Candidate Tinubu because of the assumed reality that the south is much more liberal than the north in terms of religious inclusion and plurality.  If this is the case, which is it, then why is the north - I speak to the north-east and north-west now - not driving towards tolerance and inclusion? 

The way I speak against a Muslim-Muslim ticket or a Christian-Christian combination is the way I will speak against power returning to the north beyond 2023 after a northerner has completed his eight years in Aso Rock. Only immoral persons change the rules and convention when it is convenient for them to perpetuate their biases.

6/12/22, 9:17 AM - +234 906 762 1398: ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF COMMEMORATION AND CELEBRATION OF DEMOCRACY DAY 12TH JUNE, 2022 
 

Fellow Nigerians, Today, June The 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate freedom and unity of our Nation. 

2.           From 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.  

3.           In 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice. 

4.           On June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled. 

5.           We must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria’s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future. 

6.           Fellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process. 

7.           It is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner. 

8.           I am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections. 

9.           These primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice. 

10.       I followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the Presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled. 

11.       Another positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years. 

12.       As we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a “do or die” affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers. 

13.       I will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers. 

14.       For the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes. 

15.       The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected. 

16.       I know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians. 

17.       To achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed. 

18.       On this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers.  I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely. 

19.       For those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction. 

20.       We have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed. 

21.       Our cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country’s over-all security. 

22.       I will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside. 

23.       I am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.  

24.      God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

6/12/22, 12:02 PM - SALAKO💎: *JUNE 12 DEMOCRACY DAY: OLAWALE(S) ARE GREAT PEOPLE, M.K.O ABIOLA (AUG 1937- JUL 1998) AN EMBODIED EXAMPLE!*

Whenever i remember that i share the same name with Bashorun Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola the 14th Ààrẹ ọnà kakanfo of the entirety of Yoruba race and the only Yoruba man in history to double both the title of Bashorun of Ibadan and Ààrẹ ọnà kakanfo of Yoruba land at the same time, a foremost ẹgba philanthropist known all over the world for his enormous riches not only within the Yoruba race but the entire black race during his lifetime, i never regret but feel so elated and lucky.

Bashorun Olawale Kashimawo Abiola is undoubtedly a great man of high instinct, intellect and brilliance who always has the interest of the populace at heart, he also doubles as the voice of the voiceless which i believe prompted his ambition to run for the seat of the Nigerian president in the 1993 general elections which in the history of Nigeria was the year of the most free, fair and credible election, though according to what i was able to deduce from the history i read and heard about Bashorun Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, his level of generosity was known and felt globally because he frowned and fought poverty throughout his life whenever his attention was called.

Wholeheartedly i want to appreciate my parents at this juncture for deeming it fit to have named me after the 14th Ààrẹ ọnà kakanfo and Bashorun Ibadan, so for this every June 12 is not only known as democracy day but also Olawale's day because it is the day all Nigerians were hopeful to leave the state of being in abject poverty; hopefully Olawale Abiola (the poverty enemy) has promised to eradicate poverty in our dear nation, unfortunately man processes but only the Almighty God disposes.

Nevertheless, Bashorun Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola (my namesake) was blessed with two special women in his lifetime i.e his mother Suliat and his wife Khudirat, he was known to be ọmọ arúgbó (i.e child of the old parent) because his mother gave birth to him at old age and his wife Khudirat was God's sent who was also known to be a very strong and supporting pillar to her husband till her last breath.

"Iwaju Abiola owo ni, Ẹyin Abiola owo ni, Ọtun Abiola owo ni, Osi Abiola owo ni, ki ori ṣemi l'olowo bi Olawale Abiola".

Conclusively, my namesake was a philanthropist who touched and influenced a lot of people all around the world, i pray to be like him not just by name but to be a successful philanthropist who'll always be reckoned with in life and always be remembered after death. Behold another Olawale is coming to continue the good legacy from where he stopped!

God bless Nigeria

6/12/22, 12:08 PM - +234 813 948 8163: *HOW TO KNOW A VIRGIN GIRL FROM HER FACIAL SKIN SIGNATURE...* 

A Chinese scientist who is based in the UK has published his claims in London Times magazine and Voice of London magazine too that his six years research has finally come out with an impressive result which has made it possible to recognize a virgin without having sex with her.

According to his claims, during an interview he can recognise a virgin from two poles away and he has publicly revealed the tricks to this awesome discovery on a live TV broadcast.

During a 30-minute live interview on BBC, which also was re-telecasted on CNN and other VIP world TVs like Channels TV, he has this to say through his interpreter:
"Against popular beliefs, sagged breasts don't really imply a lost virginity and torn hymen does not also mean virginity is lost. Pimples on the face is not an expressway of knowing a virgin. The only way to know a virgin is this.
When a girl is coming from about 3 poles away, watch her direction of movement and tactically move to the left, which would by impulse make her move to the right. Quietly walk beside her, then pass and go on your way to the nearest INEC office to collect your PVC.

Her virginity is none of your business. We need you to vote and ensure the right people are voted into power.

 *GO GET YOUR PVC!* 
 *THANK YOU* ✍✍✍
6/12/22, 12:39 PM - +234 814 235 8262: Today is the day when we remember the years before and look at the possibilities before us in order to strive for even better future. We should remember not to leave the faith of our country in the hands of our leaders alone, as it is the responsibility of everyone to make it greater. 

Have faith in Nigeria and happy Democracy Day!

Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu had the highest number of vote in the 1992 senatorial election in Nigeria.

Other senators-elect wanted him to be the senate president and he wanted it too. 

He was a brilliant, rich and influential young senator.

But before the senate could choose, Abiola had indicated interest to contest for president of Nigeria.

The Jagaban  immediately withdrew his ambition because he felt that it would damage Abiola’s chances of winning SDP presidential ticket since both of them were from SW.

That was how Dr Iyorchia Ayu became the senate president instead of Bola Tinubu.

Abiola went for the election and won both the primaries and the general elections.

That election was annulled by the Babangida military junta for no just cause.

Tinubu wasn’t the only one that was involved in the struggle to get the mandate back but he alongside Pa Rewane were the major financiers of NADECO.

Tinubu became a target of the Abacha men but he escaped through Benin Republic bother to US.

Tinubu retuned to Nigeria after the death of Gen Sani Abacha and rode to the seat of the governor of Lagos state mainly because of his role in the June 12 struggle.

When Obasanjo became the president too based on the June 12 injustice, Tinubu approached him several times on the need to honour the memory of Abiola and June 12 but Obj did nothing. When he was asked by Abdulsalami to choose the day he wanted to be sworn in, he choose the funny date of May 29.

When Jonathan came and same pressure was mounted on him and he wanted to be re-elected, he opted to name University of Lagos Moshood Abiola University, MAU. 

It was rejected.

Buhari became the president after him and Tinubu went to him too but this time, Asiwaju was lucky.

President Muhammadu Buhari gave Abiola a posthumous greatest award in Nigeria, the Grand Commander of the Federal Republic and Fawehinmi the Grand Commander of Nigeria and named June 12 Democracy Day.

President Buhari apologized to the family of Abiola on behalf the Nigerian state.

Next year’s June 12 Democracy Day shall be celebrated with Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the president by the grace of God. Inshallah!

Happy Democracy Day.

OBI BOWS TO PRESSURE, BACKS ATIKU WITH CONDITION

Finally, Obi has succumbed to pressures to be VP to Atiku Abubakar the presidential candidate of PDP.

This comes 21hrs after PDP hinted Atiku on the need to woo Obi back to the PDP. 

According to reports, former President Goodluck Jonathan also spoke with Obi on phone and assured him that the South East will enjoy the Atiku Abubakar administration in all aspect 

In a statement, Obi Cubana said he can only accept to be VP if Atiku can help him market his Odogwu Bitters as his official campaign drink.

Happy Democracy Day ....!

Do you know how careless you are with saying your version of truth ? Why don’t they call you jumping for that ? Now cause one of the pair of shoe fits you na jumping ? Ask around how your opinion sounds with people too.

Yeah I said you had enough time to prepare, cause it hit you doesn’t mean it’s wrong.

OBI BOWS TO PRESSURE, BACKS ATIKU WITH CONDITION

Finally, Obi has succumbed to pressures to be VP to Atiku Abubakar the presidential candidate of PDP.

This comes 21hrs after PDP hinted Atiku on the need to woo Obi back to the PDP. 

According to reports, former President Goodluck Jonathan also spoke with Obi on phone and assured him that the South East will enjoy the Atiku Abubakar administration in all aspect 

In a statement, Obi Cubana said he can only accept to be VP if Atiku can help him market his Odogwu Bitters as his official campaign drink.

Happy Democracy Day ....!

6/13/22, 2:51 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): In 1999,Funsho Williams was supposed to be the Governor of Lagos state but AD gave the slot to Tinubu.

Funsho Williams was angry and he left AD for PDP.

While in 2003,Tinubu was loved by the people and he won second term on landslide victory.

In 2006, the popularity of funsho williams was so strong that the governorship of lagos was certain but he never survived that year. He was assassinated on July 27,2006. His death till date hangs on PDP and AD now APC.

Abeit, a man named SAULA,a political thug to the lagos state led Tinubu ,AD govt was alleged to have carried out the assassination. Somehow, when tension became so tensed, SAULA too was assassinated. 

Was it not funny that an illiterate thug was promised a commissioner position in lagos but died shortly after his arrival from MECCA?

You can logically add the lines.

We are not serious yet in Nigeria.

God won't come down to help us.

6/14/22, 7:07 AM - +234 811 852 9190: *THE LONG AWAITED NIGERIAN POLITICAL REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN* .

A New Nigeria Is Possible.

Results of any Election in Nigeria can no longer be changed at the collation centres! 

Rigging of 2023 Elections is nearly impossible.  All results will be transmitted from 176, 846 polling units to INEC’s server and can be viewed by anyone from all the World online real time.

The implication is that the winner of the 2023 Presidential Elections shall be known by 7pm on the Election Day without waiting for INEC pronouncement. 

Everything has changed with the new Electoral Act recently signed into law by President Buhari few months ago. 

The law allows Electronic transmission of results from the polling booths hence rendering Political contractors, ballot box snatchers and result sheets manipulators useless. 

Also, the new rule that no one can vote if the accreditation machine does not read his or her PVC and that the number of votes cast must not be more than the number of voters accredited. To be accredited, the machine must either read the voter’s fingerprint or the face and nothing more. 

You can now understand why the Youth are rushing to get their PVC. They have learnt that they can determine who leads them. They no longer want those Politicians who had lived out their own Youth and are now determined to spend that of their Children and Grandchildren. 

Nigerian Youth consist of 65% of the current Population. 

As at 2019,  INEC had a total of 84, 004, 084 registered voters.

But, Only 28, 614,190 turned out to vote for President, and Buhari won with 15, 191, 847 votes. 

The worrying news to the Political establishment is that there are more than 48 Million Nigerian Youth of voting age. And they are annoyingly trooping out to obtain their PVCs. A Political tsunami is about to happen as Millions of Youth jostling to get their PVCs have a different idea on who to vote for. 

They no longer listen to anyone neither do the majority of them believe in tribal marks. If they are not stopped, the results of the 2023 Elections will shock the world. 

I knew that with President Buhari’s signing of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill that the days of Political Principalities playing with the future of Nigerian Youth are numbered. 

The only option left for the owners of political structures here and there is sharing money at the polling booths as was done at their primaries elections. But the anger I see on the faces of these youths is so fierce; it seems as if it has been bottled up for so long waiting for a vent. But, stop to think of this: 

 _What suddenly made the Youth to get interested in voting?  Could it be that one of the Political Parties has selected someone with the right message for them?  Are the Youth shifting from their abode in the social media to real life especially now their votes can count_ ? 

We shall find out on February 25, 2023, the day of the Presidential Election.

Curiously, many of the youths seem more interested in the presidential election. 

The good news is that INEC has promised to register every Nigerian willing to vote.  

Nigerians, this is the time to walk your talk, give life to your prayers and produce the President of your dream. 

We now have the Power in our Votes.

6/14/22, 5:04 PM - +234 705 594 3652: This is misplaced priorities because There is a current memo credited to NIITDA where they intend to gag the media and restrict freedom of speech. 

There is also a young lady who is currently tweeting from the kidnapper's den en route to only God knows where but hey emi lolan. 

We have a serious issue on our hands but we are busy helping those who brought us this carnage back to power....again....it will touch all of us. If you think you are spared think well.  

This election is personal to me and I will put everything within my power to fight the status quo.

6/14/22, 5:08 PM - +234 817 014 8364: @2347055943652 ,If PO wins without having allies such as governors, HOA memberd federal and states. How would he work effectively.

That was what bore my earlier question of him using his person to win his party political seats and build a strong base for himself lest all his visions would b in futility cuz it will be frustrated.

More so, after winning I see him cross carpeting that's his only option if he wants to govern and that's IF he wins
6/14/22, 5:08 PM - +234 817 014 8364: 🤣
6/14/22, 5:11 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Been there done that, when he won his election in Anambra, he was not having the backing of the house. Don't forget that he got his mandate from the court due to being impeached. 

Let's worry about getting him into power first. Even a government that had minorities still face pushback. The house will align when they sense a competent person at the apogee office.
6/14/22, 5:13 PM - +234 817 014 8364: Even tradition house no dey align with Tasuedsu pressy wey no b from us.

6/14/22, 5:17 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Let me paint a scenario, Don Sharon is the current OO1 who looks very incompetent considering his tides but he is yet to be impeached. If he gets his acts right, nobody will instigate an impeachment proceedings considering caucus standings because there is a constitution and a pool of constituents. 

The thing is, competence transcends party, while it may look hard, Peter Obi still has a lot of good will that we are referring to years after leaving Anambra. 

Competence will make your enemies pitch their tents with you.

6/14/22, 5:22 PM - +234 810 815 2940: @2347055943652 you need to realize we have 3 categories of voters

2. Those who vote for an individual they are getting a kind of advantage from regardless of the quality of the person

3. Those who vote for the best option after sampling all available options regardless of the party


Don't force people to see the light from your window

The voting populace is even more polarised than this when you start adding things like religion, ethnicity and more. 

I can't force anyone to vote na, you are an adult. What I can do is give you reasons why you should vote ABC, admonish you to vote wisely. I  won't follow you to the polling unit not even the candidates can. 

Please let's not misconstrue having a conversation as convincing or forcing people to vote anybody.

Or why should an Atiku who is part of putting us in darkness and stealing (Halliburton scandal) should not come near the Apex office of the Nation 😇.

Let’s know who you are and what line you stand upon.

Be driven by vision to achieve rather than beating others. So that’s why you should preach your aspirant the right way, I mean cause you genuinely want them and not wanting em cause of you don’t want who others want. 

Your Suppose principal is been preached the same way APC aspirants was preached in 2015, integrity for Buhari and Pastor for Osibajo, of course all Nigerians wanted the change, if it’s the change we envisaged I don’t know, if it’s another version of change I know not. 
Should OBI emerge, he’s the new Buhari/Osibajo cause same method used in 2015 is what y’all is trying to adopt, let’s see if you can someone’s theory better than them.

Mobilize your people, give ‘em whatever reason they should support him, we all don’t gotta succumb to your ideology, understand the concept of individualism.

Asiwaju is the Man for me cause He is the One, not cause I hate Obi or Despise Atiku, so you can do better sir or Maam 🙏.

Honestly you are deviating from the core things. I have only stated facts and that's what I will continue to do.

He negotiated with them, and paid some but they revolted and he dissolved them and employed them into the new ones. PO never owed anyone salaries when he was governor 😇. Next!

OBI BOWS TO PRESSURE, BACKS ATIKU WITH CONDITION

Finally, Obi has succumbed  to pressures to be VP to Atiku Abubakar the presidential candidate of PDP.

This comes 21hrs after PDP hinted Atiku on the need to woo Obi back to the PDP. 

According to reports, former President Goodluck Jonathan also spoke with Obi on phone and assured him that the South East will enjoy the Atiku Abubakar administration in all aspect 

In a statement, Obi Cubana said he can only accept to be  VP if Atiku can help him market his Odogwu Bitters as his official campaign drink.

Have a great day!!!

6/15/22, 9:20 AM - +234 810 823 0868: He's one of the problem of this country
6/15/22, 9:21 AM - +234 810 619 9957: Hmmm afi suru
6/15/22, 9:22 AM - +234 810 918 7203: Gbaja is already in the house, even before the 2023 Elections.
6/15/22, 9:22 AM - +234 906 762 1398: 😂
6/15/22, 9:24 AM - +234 810 918 7203: Ehn na 😂 😂 😂 😂


I doubt if there's any candidate from any party, contesting against him, since 2015.
6/15/22, 9:33 AM - +234 816 463 6464: Bobo yen ya weray gan 😂

3 Gbajabiamila brothers contested in 1999 or thereabout and na only him win and never left.

He is also loved in his federal constituent.... Whoever contest against him is only wasting time and money
6/15/22, 9:34 AM - +234 903 224 4825: What if you contest against him ?
6/15/22, 9:34 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Odidi 170?

6/15/22, 9:44 AM - +234 816 463 6464: Gbaja is a different breed in Surulere.... Most of the things happening in his constituent were done/instigated by him.... 

What is APC in Surulere without the mention of Gbajabiamila.... So he is loved regardless of Surulere being dominated by APC....

6/15/22, 10:50 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): • AKIN ALABI DISSOCIATES SELF FROM ONAARA…

•SAYS HE OWES THEM NOTHING
 
•ASKS THAT THEY DEMAND THEIR DIVIDEND OF DEMOCRACY FROM SEYI, TESSY AND FADEYI…

Youths of Ona Ara Local Government area of Oyo state has expressed their dissatisfaction and annoyance over some statements made by Mr. Akin Alabi; the honorable representing their constituency in the Federal House of Representatives. 

Akin Alabi who hails from Egbeda Local Government(a sister local government to OnaAra) made these unprintable statements on Sunday 12th of June, 2022 while chilling out at a popular lounge in Egbeda Local Government.

Mr Alabi who was challenged by concerned OnaAra youths over the dilapidated bridge of a popular river known as ODO ONI GBESE(or ODO OLOWO), is said to have responded carelessly by asking them to go and ask their children and to spare him as he has nothing to offer since the state Governor(Governor Seyi Makinde), the senator representing Oyo Central senatorial district(Senator Teslim Folarin) and the Oyo State Deputy Speaker(Hon. Abiodun Fadeyi) all hails from the same local government.

The youths while expressing their disappointment says after the whole argument between them and the honorable, he (Akin Alabi) then proceeded by asking people to form a queue then shared a sum of thirty thousand Naira.

They also added that the event has really revealed the kind of representative he is, and that he has no interest of the people of OnaAra in mind.

They call on the constituents to open their eyes widely as they elect another representative in the coming general election, also noted that Akin Alabi has shown that he doesn’t deserve their votes anymore.

But one thing stood out as a lesson, in deed the people you helped, supported, and encouraged each day do not forget your kind gestures. 
Let us live each day putting smiles on faces, spreading love and doing everything to make those around us have a feeling that love exists. 

I am indeed grateful for all gifts, messages and calls. God bless you all.

6/16/22, 8:50 PM - +234 811 852 9190: Electoral Law in Retrospect...

👇🏿FOOD 4 THOUGHT 👇🏿

.
Going through the primaries, you will realise that the 109 senators and the 360 house of rep members never actually read through the new electoral amendment act..
.
They were just screaming, "Mr President sign! Sign! Sign!" without even knowing what they have sent to him to sign..
To sound elitist, a lot people kept disturbing our eyes and ears with.. "Muhammadu Buhari is scared of signing!".. what do you know was to be signed.. These lots never showed their constituencies!
.
From the selection of only delegates.. these funny politicians didn't even know when they wrote off their statutory delegates!
.
Like football coaches, it was their duty to inform their parties that egwu apù go kwa naa jolome!
.
They don't even know when they nipped in what made the Yørúbas opt for another candidate other than Yemi Osibanjo, because a VP who has done 2 terms can now only do a one term as president.
.
This was where Ebele Goodluck Jonathan was sorting for clarification, to know if he is still eligible because, he has done VP that jumped into two terms and a one term President.
.
PDP has not told their supporters that by the new electoral laws, Atiku Abubakar can only do a one term, haven done 2 terms as VP.
.
The new law does not permit anyone who has contested for primaries in one party to skip to another for any position in the same election year. So the Mr.Peter Obi coming to PDP or NNPP  Kwankwasiya teaming with Peter Obi is gone..
.
The law does not even permit that any of those that has contested for any position to take up any other in the same year.. so the story of Nyesom Wike or Yahaya Bello, being a VP is off for 2023.. cos they can't aspire for president and VP in the same electoral year.
.
In fact, the scenerio that made Atiku a VP can't happen again, where he won as governor and was later picked by Olusegun Obasanjo..
.
Biko nu.. as you are struggling to get your PVC, struggle to know the rules of the game! Go and read and understand the Electoral Laws before these guys go slam us from behind and we will go back and blame PDP vs APC..
*News flash*
*Any aspirant who has contested say in APC is not qualified to contest for any election in another PARTY in this same General Election 2023!*

6/17/22, 10:12 AM - +234 817 014 8364: Nuhu Ribadu was ACN's presidential candidate in 2011. 

The party wanted a SE running mate, but every notable politician declined. 

Only for Fola Adeola to be drafted. 

It just occurred to me now that the ticket was Muslim - Muslim. - 

Fola was a founder of GTB. 

Maybe history go repeat itself
6/17/22, 10:16 AM - +234 816 463 6464: I thought of it few days ago and it just struck me that ACN wasn't a thing to deliberate on then or should I say Politics hasn't entered the social media then
6/17/22, 10:28 AM - +234 817 014 8364: Two things,Ponmo and data boys never plenty

Secondly religion doesn't always count, always region but now we wan de woke
6/17/22, 10:29 AM - +234 817 014 8364: Southwest was compensated with presidency because of Abiola annulled elections.

If religion was deep rooted as it is now, they for give southwest muslim instead of obj
6/17/22, 10:39 AM - +234 816 463 6464: But was there ever a time when Religion had to be a thing in electing Leaders aside 92/93 election
6/17/22, 10:40 AM - +234 706 452 6359: Trending on the social media and the author is unknown but they are facts:

* Going through the primaries, you will realise that the 109 senators and the 360 house of rep members never actually read through the new electoral amendment act. 
They were just screaming, "Mr President sign! Sign! Sign!" without even knowing what they have sent to him to sign.
To sound elitist, a lot of people kept on disturbing our eyes and ears with .. "Muhammadu Buhari is scared of signing!".. what do you know was to be signed.. These lots never showed up in their constituencies!!!!
From the selection of only delegates.. these funny politicians didn't even know when they wrote off their statutory delegates!!! They wrote off themselves and nobody detected the error. 
Like football coaches, it was their duty to inform their parties that the game has changed!

* They don't even know when they nipped in what made the Yørúbas opted for another candidate other than Yemi Osibanjo, because a VP who has done 2 terms can now only do a one term as President. 

* This was where Ebele Goodluck Jonathan was seeking for clarification, to know if he is still eligible because, he has done VP that jumped into two terms and a one term President.

* PDP people have not told their supporters that by the new electoral laws, Atiku Abubakar can only do a one term, having done 2 terms as a VP. 

* The new law does not permit anyone who has contested for primaries in one party to skip to another for any position in the same election year.  Interesting !!! Segun Oni of Ekiti,  how market oooo??? 

* The Peter Obi coming to PDP or NNPP  Kwankwasiya teaming with Peter Obi is no more possible. End of discussion. 

* The law does not even permit that any of those that has contested for any position to take up any other in the same year.. so the story of Nyesom Wike or Yahaya Bello, being a VP is off for 2023 bc they can't aspire for president and VP in the same electoral year. 

* Senate President Ahmed Lawan, Akpabio, Badaru etc who have variously contested can not vie for Senatorial position or Vice Presidency respectively. Me: say no more. 

* In fact, the scenerio that made Atiku a VP can't happen again, where he won as governor and was later picked by Olusegun Obasanjo. 

* As we are struggling to get our PVC, struggle to know the rules of the game! Go and read and understand the new Electoral Laws. Happy reading 9ja.

6/17/22, 11:19 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Exactly
.so that they would be part of the primaries. Thieves!
6/17/22, 11:21 AM - Safe journey: I think this is part of the reason Atiku don't choose Wike as VP... Just to obey the law

We just dey do analysis, we don't know the law🤣🤣

Good roads is of a higher priority than airports. Cos how many people travel inter state with flight Sev 🤒

But that's not enough as a basis for Nigeria to waste funds on airports
6/17/22, 11:59 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I thought too

6/17/22, 12:01 PM - +234 810 619 9957: We dont need many airport in Nigeria abeg we lack maintenance culture. A new terminal was built in Lagos intl airport while the old terminal stills as roof licking and sometimes passengers arriving late at night as no staff to clear them SMH

6/17/22, 12:01 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Learned this earlier in life, no matter the money I borrow you, I am never expecting it back. If you refund fine, if you don't fine, I already moved on the moment I sent it to you. Same thing I do when I keep money with people.

Means means half of USA's Air cargo importation comes through Cali (calculate the impart on the state's IGR)

They provide private hangar to over 100 private jets (calculate the taxes/fees)

Calculate the employment opportunities that would bring to the state.

That is California highest grossing industry per day
6/17/22, 12:22 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Grateful to God but it was a total setback to my life.
6/17/22, 12:23 PM - +234 703 446 8168: It’s a good law nAh…it doesn’t allow bromance of many parties and can’t vie for two positions at a time.
6/17/22, 12:23 PM - Iseyemi: Omo... 
You're a strong man... 🥺

Ha😓
6/17/22, 12:24 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Let me paraphrase. The more wealth you create, the more wealthy people become and the need for more airports. Nigeria can be like this if not for brain drain, terrible policies and stupid leaders. Create wealth, allow people thrive and we may be mimicking these people.
6/17/22, 12:24 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Do u know how much Ogun is losing to Lagos cos every air cargo or passenger must go through Lagos?

Imagine the number of people who travel to Abk, Ijebu, oya and every major city in Ogun, they all pass through Lagos
6/17/22, 12:24 PM - +234 810 619 9957: It wasn’t we all have stories to tell. Trust me u might not like where u are now but u are where God wants you to be. Its a process and u must follow it squarely. When its time, u wont see it coming self.

6/17/22, 12:25 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Hmmm i can imagine o
6/17/22, 12:25 PM - Iseyemi: Yeah ... Yeah...

6/17/22, 12:28 PM - +234 705 594 3652: Build the connecting corridors, build the roads in the state and attract investors since you have proximity to the cash cow but we have docile leaders.
6/17/22, 12:31 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Just like the issue of port. Only Apapa port and it can’t accommodate again i see no reason why calabar port is not functioning those within SS & SE would no longer have to come to Lagos to clear their goods. Effective railway self will do a lot in transportation of containers and cargo goods from Lagos to anywhere particularly down to the North. We should also have bonded terminal in other state to stack the containers when they via Train.
6/17/22, 12:32 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Lagos is a money laundering scheme

I feel if BAT picks a running mate that the North doesn’t support more people will decamp.
6/17/22, 4:02 PM - +234 703 446 8168: The governors will suggest a pool of names to him…it’s his decision to pick from the pool

6/17/22, 4:06 PM - +234 703 446 8168: He is more likely to loose that re-election bid…
6/17/22, 4:06 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Most likely
6/17/22, 4:07 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Depends on which party is stronger in the state too…the presidential election will have a lot to play here
6/17/22, 4:10 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Hmmm Lawan get him crowd sha and just like dogara himself empower people. So that might help his vote sha
6/17/22, 4:12 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Of course, every politician no matter the magnitude or level has his own crowd!

One thing is, the APC faithfuls in that senatorial district will stay back. He will win unless the people of that senatorial district can’t read meanings to self-centredness…THE SAME ISSUE WITH DOGARA & SARAKI then

6/17/22, 6:16 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Breaking: APC submits name of Tinubu’s running mate to INEC

The All Progressives Congress has submitted the name of the running mate of its presidential candidate for the 2023 elections, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to the Independent National Electoral Commission.

This was confirmed by a source in the Tinubu Campaign Organisation in the early hours of Thursday.

The name submitted to the electoral umpire was Alhaji Kabir Ibrahim Masari, who is said to be from Katsina State and a kinsman of the State Governor, Rt. Hon. Aminu Masari.

Source informed that the submission of Masari’s name was an interim measure in order to meet the deadline of INEC for the submission of names of candidates for national elections.

The INEC had given the deadline as July 17, 2022 (today).

The source described Masari as a “place-holder” as the search for a vice presidential candidate for Tinubu continues.

As reported by The Eagle Online earlier on, the search for a running mate for Tinubu has been zoned to the North, with the likelihood of a Muslim from among serving or past governors clinching it.

This has largely given an inkling of a Muslim-Muslim ticket.

This is as those said to be in contention are all Muslims.

Among them are the Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje; Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai; Jigawa State Governor, Abubakar Bagudu; Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum; and former Borno State Governor, Kashim Shettima.

The Peoples Democratic Party had on Thursday unveiled Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State as the running mate of Atiku Abubakar for the 2023 elections.

Tolu is a reflection of Amosun as far they're concerned and might not have the balls to contest for Gov in 2027 against his Boss wish....

Their best bet is Solomon...and I say Goodluck to them 😂
6/18/22, 8:25 AM - +234 810 815 2940: So this 2 u mentioned are the only credible people from the whole districts

All their Olu of Ilaro cares about is who becomes Senator.
Awujale cares do much about development, looking at his roles when Amosun tried scrapping TASUED.
Amosun built a school for them in Ipokia, they neglected it for farming, Ijebus won't do that.

6/18/22, 9:29 AM - +234 809 866 4771: EDUCATION Under Tinubu in Lagos State:

Now tell me what has your ATIKU or PETER OBI did on Education while as a Vice President and Governor of Anambra state respectively. In fact, the former even capitalized on the longest ASUU strike in history to open an American University where only his likes could take their children.

My point is, Let's stop stereotyping and mocking YOUTH for non-participation in an election....

Let's advocate for YOUTH having more confidence in our electoral system
6/18/22, 1:09 PM - +234 703 446 8168: And not to sell votes too
6/18/22, 1:10 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Hmmm i get u bt how do we advocate the more when the ongoing Election where we ought to exercise our civil right by voting and test run our strength and unity is on low ba3 😂

6/18/22, 1:20 PM - SALAKO💎: Exactly leader

If I am approached by 5 political parties, I will promise them all and vote my preferred candidate.

6/18/22, 1:20 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Na why some people dey carry PO for head be that..... They genuinely want to change (not APC 2015 change please) the narrative and they're ready to spend their hard earned money to campaign for him.....

Same with those pushing PYO.....

Take PO out of 2023 election and you will see majority of the youth making noise today back in their respective shells

6/18/22, 2:28 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Now you’re getting my point…

Gravitating from ‘GET YOUR PVC’ to ‘HOPE THEY VOTED THEIR CANDIDATES OF CHOICE’

A certain percentage of these youths will still sell their votes 🗳.

It’s sad 😔 but it’s the reality.
6/18/22, 2:29 PM - +234 810 619 9957: 😂😂😂
6/18/22, 2:29 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Tell them and explain to them what they want na

6/18/22, 2:33 PM - +234 816 463 6464: I won't agree with your 3rd paragraph.....

You can only say about yourself and those around you....

Let's stop the generalisation please

6/18/22, 2:53 PM - +234 703 446 8168: What are you saying?

“A certain percentage of these youths will still sell their votes 🗳”

You no understand English again?

If one youth sells his vote, then it’s a certain percentage of the youths…you can only disagree when it is sure for you that no youth will sell his/her vote!
6/18/22, 2:55 PM - +234 810 619 9957: @2348164636464 bellieves we shouldn’t generalize our opinion but he tends to mis understand us i guess.
6/18/22, 2:55 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Take yourself out of the "us" 😂😂😂😂

6/18/22, 2:56 PM - +234 810 619 9957: But you have done  something similar today to me now 😂
6/18/22, 2:56 PM - +234 703 446 8168: I will generalise only when I say “ALL YOUTHS WILL SELL THEIR VOTES.”

But “a certain percentage” is safer to saying “a good number”

6/18/22, 5:06 PM - +234 813 288 6674: Bro,

Do you have confidence in NEPA before you fix light in your house.
We all know they're nonsense that it is our solar and Gen that will sort us, but we still connect NEPA light in case and because we feel it's a norm.

We should also take that kind of reasoning to governance too.
Your vote will count or not, go and vote because it's your right.
I waited two weeks in Ijebu-Ode to vote GNI, and I didn't collect the 5k PDP shared.

I don't know if my illustration make any sense but...

Mr. Biodun A Oyebanji BAO

Ado-Ekiti 
 
Dear BAO,

CONGRATULATION ON YOUR VICTORY

Following the  announcement of your victory in the June 18 Ekiti Governorship Election by the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC, I hereby write to congratulate you accordingly.

I believe that power belongs to God and He bestows upon whoever he chooses.

I also believe in popular choice ie the unfettered expression of the peoples mandate as one of the crucial hallmarks of democratic principle and practice. 
Democracy must therefore deliver to the people dividends of security or protection and enhance their social welfare and well-being basically,and among other deliverables. 

These were the motivation for my own ambition in the governorship of Ekiti state which I feel strongly to reiterate here in view of the precarious situations of our people at the moment.
Please take urgent actions aimed at redressing the plights of our people when you fully assume the mantle shortly.

Finally,I wish you the guidance of the almighty God in the onerous task ahead. 

Congratulations to your spouse and also  running mate.

And one the candidate must be from SW. 

That's why imams and pastors in the SW are staying away from condemning APC for tinkering Muslim Muslim ticket.

Baba is from the IBSW LG.

Maybe his polling unit is in front of a mosque but not “Iwo Road Mosque.”

It was after his Coronation that full politics was introduced into the traditional settings of Kings...(My opinion)
6/20/22, 2:36 PM - Safe journey: The Only question I will ask you is

Is there anything like Oba of Lagos before?
6/20/22, 2:50 PM - +234 810 918 7203: Yes.
6/20/22, 2:50 PM - +234 810 918 7203: It was known to be Eleko of Eko and some still address the king like that.
6/20/22, 2:55 PM - Safe journey: Bcos his territory no pass within Island

But now it was politicial from regime of Akiolu nd it was Tinubu that made him to be head of all Kings in Lagos

A white cap chief for that matter

A king without no crown 👑
6/20/22, 2:58 PM - +234 906 684 1637: You wrong

6/20/22, 2:59 PM - +234 906 684 1637: Before akinolu it was oba oyekan the roles and post of white cap chief and king is different,Eleko of Eko as a crown
6/20/22, 3:00 PM - +234 810 918 7203: You can call the Ashipa (first ọba) as a white cap chief. (Baale)
6/20/22, 3:00 PM - +234 810 918 7203: White cap chief is different from Ọba.
6/20/22, 3:00 PM - +234 906 684 1637: The white chief comprises of royal and chieftaincy
6/20/22, 3:01 PM - +234 810 918 7203: From history, the Ọba of Lagos from the reign of Adele, has been the head of all kings and Baale.

Who Eko help when Oba Kosoko was dethroned by white men before he migrated to EPE

Do you know that, this is the reason why EPE has two Oba today

Oloja Of EPE &
Elepe of EPE

Is Olisa of ijebu ode a king ?
6/20/22, 3:37 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Civilization is why they call it Oba of Lagos now

Remember Lagos is an English rooted word

Now, Lagos is regarded as the English of Eko
6/20/22, 3:37 PM - Safe journey: And Hadura dey tell me when when Epe came into existence... Erin de pami Sha


Incase you don't know

EPE nd Lagos Island that share a boundary


All those Ajah , Eti-Osa, Awoyaya, all those lekki are Old EPE... 

That is why once you get to Lekki face 1, You will see, EPE kilometers remain


All those area are Old EPE
6/20/22, 3:37 PM - +234 810 815 2940: But that doesn't erase the origin of the kingship
6/20/22, 3:38 PM - +234 810 890 0039: Leader please help clarify

Oba of eko turned oba of Lagos bah?
6/20/22, 3:40 PM - Safe journey: GOD bless you my brother

This is what most don't understand

They now believe everywhere in Lagos State is EKO

Even person wey dey go Badagry, he will say he dey go EKO (Lagos)
6/20/22, 3:40 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Eleko of Eko became Oba of Lagos with civilization
6/20/22, 3:40 PM - +234 810 890 0039: Is it just the name that changed or the position changed too
6/20/22, 3:41 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Just name
6/20/22, 3:41 PM - Safe journey: I think Olisa is second in command after the King
6/20/22, 3:41 PM - +234 810 815 2940: The position Vis still has strong as it is
6/20/22, 3:42 PM - +234 810 890 0039: Just name

@2348026045965 said oba of eko(king of eko in Lagos)

Then oba of Lagos (king of the whole Lagos)
6/20/22, 3:43 PM - +234 810 890 0039: He Dey confuse me
6/20/22, 3:45 PM - +234 810 890 0039: @2348108152940
6/20/22, 3:46 PM - +234 810 815 2940: I think what he is saying is that politics made the throne more popular
6/20/22, 3:46 PM - +234 810 890 0039: He said politics made him the king of all
Kings in Lagos

Unlike oba eko which is a king of a part in Lagos
6/20/22, 3:47 PM - +234 817 014 8364: Oba of lagos is the king of Eko (which was renamed Lagos)

Other parts of Lagos state has dere kings and rulers.

However there's a ranking amongst obas and in lagos oba of lagos is the chairman in council of Obas in Lagos state
6/20/22, 3:48 PM - +234 810 890 0039: @2348026045965 Oya comman tackle o
6/20/22, 3:50 PM - +234 817 014 8364: Yes, He's literally king of olisa kingdom in ijebu ode.

Unfortunately, the awujale whose the paramount ruler of ijebu land resides in Olisa axis😂.

And we cannot have two authorities.
6/20/22, 3:50 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Ashipa came from Benin Kingdom to start the Lagos Dynasty
His son became the first Eleko of Eko now Oba of Lagos

We don't know what was the boundary of rulership then but one thing that was sure is, there was no other kingdom in Lagos then

So technically, he is the kind of other kings
6/20/22, 3:50 PM - Safe journey: @2348108900039 still don't get it😂😂


Is there anything like Council of Obas in Lagos in 18th century

Or even before 1960
6/20/22, 3:50 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Exactly leader

This is the perfect explanation
6/20/22, 3:50 PM - +234 703 446 8168: I don’t get
6/20/22, 3:51 PM - +234 810 890 0039: True son of the soil said 
Oba of eko is the supreme oba of Lagos

Na name just change

So no Dey blame tinubu or politics for position change
6/20/22, 3:52 PM - +234 817 014 8364: Just like in every other states and Nigeria.

We have the sultan and oni ife as the Co chairs of traditional rulers in naija because of amalgamation northern and southern protectorate.

Safe to say that Oni is the Chairman in council of all kings in southern naija
While the sultan is the chairman in county of all emirs and rulers in northern naija

6/20/22, 5:29 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Looool 😂 

Ibadan does not have a ruling house like other towns, so far you’re from Ibadan, you can become the King. Therefore, each agboole (Family Compound) take the palace to their agboole when they become King. 

When you become King or close to becoming one, you start building a magnificence and befitting palace in your agboole. That’s the practice. 

And there is a general palace but it’s not used.

*FROM OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER*

*FASHINA OLATUNJI SECRETARIAT*

*TEAM LIBERTY*

*MONDAY 20TH OF JUNE, 2022.*

Dear TASUEDITES',

*CONDONEMENT OF ADMISSION*

This is to inform you that if you gained admission into Tai Solarin University of Education, Ijagun, Ijebu - Ode, Ogun State from 2017 - 2020, which you are yet to be given admission by Jamb or see Jamb admission letter on your jamb portal, kindly visit the Jamb State office at Abeokuta for the Application for Condonement of Admission from today Monday, 20th of June, 2022 - Friday 24th of June, 2022.

One of the consequences of not being given admission by Jamb is that it will affect mobilization (NYSC) of such students affected at the end of his/her academic pursuit which can hinder graduation. 

With deep consultations done towards this development, kindly be informed that the condonement of admission can only be done at the hosted state of any institution across the federation, the deadline is on the 24th of June, 2022.

If you are in this category, kindly adhere strictly to this and take advantage because it might not be seen again.

This is in regards to the publication rolled out by the Deputy Registrar (Admissions) yesterday.

*DIRECTION*
From anywhere in Abeokuta, take a cab and tell the cab man you are going to the Jamb office.

*NOTE* 
Go along with your credentials. 

For more information about TASUED, kindly get in touch with me for viable information.

Moreso, regarding the condonement of admission, kindly keep updating us to know the next step to take.

6/21/22, 12:44 PM - +234 817 014 8364: INEC said 50% of voters won't be voting because they have already register before.
6/21/22, 12:44 PM - +234 817 014 8364: According to electoral law multiple registration is a crime.
6/21/22, 12:44 PM - +234 817 014 8364: Some youth has automatically disenfranchised themselves
6/21/22, 12:47 PM - +234 703 446 8168: It’s funny but crazy!

Shey INEC’s system isn’t supposed to identify a biometric that has been uploaded on their platform before ni!

A very smart way by the government and her laws to disenfranchise educated revolutionists!
6/21/22, 12:48 PM - +234 817 014 8364: As much as I blame them. I still blame govt because if dem get work they won't doing trending things like overcrowd registration centers.

6/21/22, 12:49 PM - +234 817 356 2180: It is done intentionally.
6/21/22, 12:50 PM - +234 817 356 2180: Boss, once their details is inputted there is always a php code that query database to check if it existing
6/21/22, 12:50 PM - +234 817 014 8364: For misplacement or new ?

I misplaced my card but I reapplied for misplaced not new
6/21/22, 12:51 PM - +234 817 014 8364: Sometimes we are our own problem. Many people no wan go through stress of making available items needed for misplacement or damaged e.g afidavit , police reports
6/21/22, 12:51 PM - +234 817 356 2180: Yeah
6/21/22, 12:52 PM - +234 817 014 8364: U mean portal verification.

Thats not the koko, even if u have a portal, the system can allow u register as new person. That's what they should never had let happen.
6/21/22, 12:54 PM - +234 817 356 2180: That’s what I’m saying boss. There should be a query to check if the details exist before creating a new one

6/21/22, 12:58 PM - +234 703 446 8168: It’s not just done now…it has been like this since how many years ago…


I almost got technically disenfranchised in 2015 cos my previous active voters card was temporary only for me not to find my bio on the database…

I made sure to confirm that it was more like INEC lost some data and I had to register over again!


This time around;
They will hide under the guise of ‘multiple registration is fraud’ neglecting that it’s their fault to leave room for that.
6/21/22, 12:58 PM - +234 703 446 8168: The governor didn’t do this…no sane govt will do that rubbish!
6/21/22, 12:59 PM - +234 817 356 2180: I know it’s not just now. They already made the loophole all this while

When we conducted Lagos west election that brought in The guy from ikorodu you need to see film
Electorate with PVC yet their details is not on d card reader
We had to allow them vote manually cos even the PDP people already knew APC would win
6/21/22, 1:27 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Shey INEC don get database ni?
6/21/22, 1:29 PM - +234 703 446 8168: This is actually valid and it is in accordance with the constitution…

If the card reader doesn’t read your card, it doesn’t mean the voter doesn’t have a data on the card reader.

As a matter of fact, card readers don’t store voter’s information, it only verifies the authenticity of the card.

If a voters name is on the voters registered (pasted), then such voter has a data with INEC.
6/21/22, 1:31 PM - +234 703 446 8168: I can confirm the database post OBJ regime, improved in 2011, YES. More improvement in 2015, YES.

Good data management since then, I CANT BE SURE!

What kind of advice is that?

Lodge in her ‘ONLE ONE APARTMENT’… enjoy the ambience of the 3 beds and RIGMAROLE the nooks and crannies of her 🐱.
6/21/22, 1:42 PM - +234 816 463 6464: And a PVC is not supposed to be read twice....

Once you read it on a CR, the system should automatically save the data on it and disallow double reading....

But reverse was the case in 2019.... Na the technique wey I use manipulate votes be that
6/21/22, 1:44 PM - +234 816 463 6464: So na only me get pure and clean mindset for here 🥹.... 

I used to think you were one 🤐
6/21/22, 1:45 PM - +234 903 702 6702: Congratulations 🥳
6/21/22, 1:47 PM - +234 703 446 8168: And how were you able to make a corresponding number with your voter’s register?

If you read a card twice;
• it means you have the same person twice
• how did your APO 2 manage to tick the name of the person twice on the same voter’s register?
• how did you correspond the number of card read with the number of persons ticked on the register and with the number of ballot papers issued?

Technically, you allowed one person vote twice???
6/21/22, 1:48 PM - +234 817 014 8364: Y lodge in one, when u can have the three to ur selves?

Have u heard of multiple entry system !!!

6/21/22, 1:52 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Are you really asking me these questions 🤣

I said I manipulated votes and you still dey question my ability to manipulate 💯....

One of my APOs brought the mess upon me and I did what I had to do.....

Mind you, my total votes before the manipulation started was already twice accredited voters... 

Do I need to explain further... Wo mo lu INEC ni gibiti

TRANSPLANT - transferring the organ of someone to be used for another person (mostly legal)…

HARVEST- illegal removal of organs to be sold on the black market.
6/23/22, 4:46 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Sure, but it is most likely the families aren’t aware of them being organ harvesters

6/23/22, 4:48 PM - +234 810 815 2940: They may be aware and still permit it, people are hungry
They will assure them they are only removing one which means the boy will still be alive after the transplant

6/23/22, 7:31 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): UPDATE:

Case heard in the magistrate court.

The sinator's daughter has kidney problems, and has been on dialysis. 

They 'contracted' a 15 yr old boy from Lagos to harvest one of his kidney in exchange for a promise of a better life.

Arranged travelling documents for the boy under a false age of 21 to come to UK.

When they got to the hospital, the doctor refused the donor.

They have both being charged with the following:

Senator: Conspire to arrange or facilitate travel of another person with a view to exploitation.

Wife: Arrange or facilitate travel of another person with a view to exploitation. 

Both denied bail and remanded to custody.

Case adjourned till July 7.

If found guilty, the offence carries a minimum sentence of 18yrs jail term.

.....

Now, let the defenders of the universe take over and start rationalising how they did it because of 'ọrọ ọmọ', as if the pikin, whose parts they wanted to harvest, wasn't born by somebody and the sinator's daughter deserves to live more than him.

......

The man a lawyer. The wife a doctor. One would have thought that they'll know better. But this is what you get when you are used to cutting corners and living anyhow. E get some environment where you'll get to and it's corners that'll cut you if you waka anyhow.

• @2348108152940 earlier said the family of the boy might know about it - that might be true.

• @2348163162679 said illegal transplant - that seems to be the truth.

• The Ekweremadus’ child is seriously ill and needs an organ in a UK hospital.

• They have obtained the boy’s passport as though he were 21 years.

• The boy confessed at the hospital that he is actually 15 years old which led to YAM PEPPER SCATTER SCATTER.

• Basically, they did that because of their sick child.

Good afternoon sir
6/24/22, 1:59 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Exclusive: Why angered Osinbajo retrieved funds from Kwara delegates.

No wonder Oyo State had to refund him too. 

Fresh fact has revealed the reason Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo recovered the money he paid Kwara delegates at the All Progressives Congress (APC) Convention, held at Eagles Square, Abuja.

Recalled that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo was one of the party's leading presidential aspirants in an election that saw the former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu clinched the party's ticket while the Vice President was in far third position.

After the collation and counting of ballots, the result suggested that Kwara was the only state that delivered a 100 percent vote to the winner (Asiwaju Bola Tinubu).

It was gathered that Osinbajo was furious for not at least getting a vote from Kwara as he ordered his ally, Engr. Tobi who was accompanied by fully armed security men to collect his money back from the Kwara delegates.

Below is the breakdown of how the delegates voted by states and geopolitical zones

6/24/22, 4:29 PM - +234 810 815 2940: That's why immediately Nigeria was formed, Lagos was named the capital 
It was Capital for close to a century
6/24/22, 4:30 PM - +234 810 815 2940: So you all should stop comparing Lagos development to any other state and accept that Lagos is not where it should be based on its history
6/24/22, 4:30 PM - +234 809 866 4771: It was a base for the colony not a capital
6/24/22, 4:30 PM - +234 809 866 4771: If it was a capital with roots then it shouldn't be shifted after independence
6/24/22, 4:31 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Lagos has been a colony for 150 Years, afterwards became the Capita of Nigeria for almost 90 years

6/24/22, 8:25 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Ekweremadu: Ukpo is Lying About Being 15 years Old

By Farooq Kperogi 

David Ukpo, who initially agreed to donate his kidney to give Ike Ekweremadu's sick daughter, Sonia, a chance to live isn't the 15-year-old kid he told British authorities he is. 

He was born on Oct. 12, 2000. That means he'll be 22 years old in October this year, as his passport and BVN data show.  (The passport and BVN data have been doing the social media rounds, but I've decided to conceal the numbers to protect his privacy). 

He was also not smuggled into London, as Ekweremadu's December 28, 2021 visa application support letter to the British High Commission shows.

I dislike Ekweremadu the politician but empathize with Ekweremadu the father. As the father of three girls myself, I'll do anything I can to save my daughters from death. That's all this is about. Nothing more.

So far, the evidence seems to be pointing in the direction of the possibility that 21-year-old Ukpo, upon arriving in the UK after agreeing to donate his kidney to Sonia, changed his mind and decided to seek asylum by claiming to be a 15-year-old child who's trafficked to London for organ harvesting.

If that turns out to be true, that would be a horrible way to escape Buhari's Nigeria. Cashing in on other people's personal tragedy--and destroying them in the process-- just to pursue your dream to leave Nigeria is singularly evil.

6/24/22, 8:41 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Read this 👇

Rumor has it that Hon Omodewu called Hon Faouzy few days ago and pleaded with him not to leave APC , he also requested him to meet with the reconciliation committee before taking any step further which he declined, and do you know why he declined,It was because the call didn't come from the right person… 

Another thing is that 50% of Accord is made up of APC members, while 20% of those 50% staying behind are largely aggrieveds as well but they  decided not show it until Election Day,which they do called judgement day amongst themselves...

As things stands, Our gubernatorial candidate need to change his approaches, he needs to come up with a working strategies. The deed had been done, those guys aren’t coming back again. Our candidate had visited two prominent Local Governments; Oluyole and Iddo, those Leaders that our gubernatorial candidate met have returned back to Accord party not even up to 24hours after their closed door meeting… and that mean NO !!! 

Guess what, The last day for any reasonable reconciliation was the night of the APC Governorship primary but ati  miss e bcos ati hope pe Asiwaju will step in..

Asiwaju Tinubu mandate got nothing to do with APC or Accord.. 

Another thing is that Asiwaju and majorly Baba Akande may not be happy with how everything started late last year and how it ended. So asking them to stop the aggrieved members may be hard for them to do but the most important thing now is to focus on the campaigns, we need Baba nla Damage Control Kini . TKF, kindly ask your boys to help you if you’re helpless and kick any idiot out if he/she tell you everything is okay, that your victory is certain.. 

Stop the reconciliation, they’re not coming back… 

Identify those inner aggrieved 20% out 50%,  beg them sincerely, reconciled them with other members and give them roles to play. 

Board politics ti over😂, No help is coming from Abuja again, no reason going there or writing any letter to Abuja to force some people to work for you, instead beg them .

Let's face Makinde, he is our common enemy not Accord members and their leaders.

 Let's talk to the masses and the electorates, convince them to vote for you(TKF) .

Let's come out of this better and stronger … 

It’s a dangerous situation right now, APC as incumbent government in 2019 didn’t survive the similar situation,not to talk of now that we are in opposition.

Otunba Odutola, an Ijebu man, bought a well from Mr Emeka Chinedu, and paid in full.
The  next day, Mr Emeka Chinedu came to meet Otunba Odutola at his office. 

Otunba: Ah, Mr Chinedu, welcome. I hope no problem o.

Mr. Chinedu: There is no problem, Otunba. I just came to tell you that I sold you the well, but not the water inside the well.
If you fetch water from the well, you will have to pay me.

Otunba: Ah, Mr.Chinedu I am very happy you came. In fact, I was just about to come and meet you.
I don't need the water in the well, I want to use the well to store some of my goods. So, I want you to come and carry all your water from the well so that water will not spoil my goods. If you don't carry your water by tomorrow, I will start charging you rent for using my well to store your water...

• Neighbours are still trying to revive Mr Chinedu who had since fainted in the street.😜😂🤪😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😂🤣😅😃😁🤪😜😝

I think I told you, no tribe in the world can compete with the great IJEBU's

Laugh and also find way of extending the laughter to others.

6/24/22, 11:15 PM - +234 809 866 4771: BREAKING NEWS 
NASS HAS SHOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT

Going through the primaries, u will realise that the 109 senators and the 360 house of rep members never actually read through the new electoral amendment act

They were just screaming, PMB sign! Sign!" without even knowing what they have sent to him to sign
To sound elitist, a lot of people kept disturbing our eyes and ears with ..PMB is scared of signing!" what do you know was to be signed. These lots never showed their constituencies

From the selection of only delegates.. these funny politicians didn't even know when they wrote off their statutory delegates

Like football coaches, it was their duty to inform their parties that the game has changed

They don't even know when they nipped in what made the Yørúbas opt for another candidate other than PYO, bcs a VP who has done 2 terms can now only do one term as president

This was where GEJ was seeking clarification, to know if he is still eligible because he has done VP that jumped into two terms and a one-term President

PDP has not told their supporters that by d new electoral laws, Atiku Abubakar can only do one term, haven did 2 terms as VP

D new law does not permit anyone who has contested for primaries in one party to skip to another for any position in the same election year. So Mr Peter Obi coming to PDP or NNPP  Kwankwasiya teaming with Peter Obi is gone

D law does not even permit any of those that have contested for any position to take up any other in the same year.. so the story of Nyesom Wike or Yahaya Bello, being a VP is off for 2023 cos they can't aspire for president & VP in the same electoral year

Senate President Ahmed Lawan, Akpabio, Bagudu etc who have variously contested can not vie for a senatorial position or Vice Presidency respectively

The scenario that made Atiku a VP can't happen again, where he won as governor and was later picked by OBJ

I beg as you are struggling to get your PVC, struggle to know the rules of the game! Go and read and understand the Electoral Laws

6/25/22, 7:51 AM - +234 810 815 2940: This is what militants in Kenya are doing, not kidnapping, not blowing up the city.

They gave a cause they are fighting for, they are trying to explain to as much people are possible, they want the people to understand their pain and their revolution. They want the people to know the war is against bad government not the good people.

Again what is the likes of Boko Haram, Fulani Herdsmen fighting for?
6/25/22, 7:51 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Over a decade now we still don't know what they really want?
6/25/22, 7:51 AM - +234 810 619 9957: True
6/25/22, 7:51 AM - +234 810 815 2940: No official statement from them to even say this is what we want the government to do
6/25/22, 7:52 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Just terrorizing everyone without a clear statement of their agitation
6/25/22, 7:53 AM - +234 810 815 2940: More than ever I now know all these Insurgency is to make money for the cabal

6/25/22, 8:07 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): First, you said the church was pushing Pastor Osinbajo for the presidency thus polarising the polity.

Now that he is out of the race, you shut up.

Muslim/Muslim ticket is hovering around us, you then tell us it is not about religion. 🤣😂

So in a country of millions of Christians, we don't deserve a place in the first seats right?
6/25/22, 8:07 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Now that PFN president has declared we should all get our PVC , you are circling the part where it says we can't cast our vote for swines.

6/25/22, 12:45 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I am sure the APC Presidential screening Committee led by John Oyegun did a thorough job during the screening,the basis upon which they disqualified some candidates but the party still threw caution to the wind by allowing all the aspirants to contest the presidential primaries, including the disqualified, whose names were not released up till now.

My memory also served me well that the last time Tinubu contested election was in 2003, that was a very long time !

The rumour of discrepancies surrounding his certificates should not be left for a mere social media defense. Thorough investigation and findings must be done by APC as a Party to ascertain the veracity of Tinubu's certificate. 

The APC won Governorship election in Bayelsa but David Lyion the candidate attempted suicide three times when he was to be sworn in on Saturday but Supreme Court ruled on Friday against his running mate due to discrepancies in certificate. 

Duoye Diri of PDP is still the Governor of Bayelsa till this morning. 

Awalokan Awalokan,kii se bi ka ma ni certificate oooo.

6/25/22, 2:56 PM - Ayprince 2019 LIS: Dear TASUEDITES, 
What is missing in the alumni system about scholarship opportunities is lack of information. 
The reason we have numbers of students from other schools in abroad through scholarship is because of available scholarship information. 

Some TASUEDITES have created a telegram to discuss about scholarship opportunities around the world. The discussion would take place tomorrow at exactly 8pm Nigerian time. 

Join the group here:
https://t.me/+EiV2uddtChdjZDFk

This is their first discussion. They'll likely invite more scholars in the future. 
This is only for interested TASUEDITES. 

Thanks.

6/25/22, 6:00 PM - +234 818 709 0967: Wao.... Great feat. This reminds me how I won the inter-platoon drama competition for my platoon back then in Emure, in Ekiti state as a result of my role.

This role spur my prominence in camp and eventually leadership role as CLO in EKSU.

Go on bro and make us all prouder.

Well done.

6/25/22, 6:01 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): There was no primary election in the constituency 

They should stop using scope

6/25/22, 6:02 PM - +234 810 619 9957: 😂😂😂 na wa o
6/25/22, 6:08 PM - +234 818 709 0967: I championed a course in this direction while on campus with Enactus.

I did thereafter after leaving school... After my scholarship with Junior Achievement Nigeria (I will like those currently in camp to apply for the coming cohort) at Lagos Business School; there I earned my MBA certification in conjunction with PAN African University.

I have helped loads of young people towards this direction.

My position as PR back then exposed me to loads of things on campus which I do share with students but little or no fewer persons have interest in such things.

Sincerely, opportunities abound.
6/25/22, 7:41 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): CIA people actually think the political space is like TASUEDSU election that they can draw pity with article and write up 😂😂

Simply and succinctly put, there are constituencies where APC did not conduct primary in Oyo state and Oorelope State Constituency is part. 

When Jimoh Adisa was supposed to protest was when the elections did not hold but be kept quiet thinking the decision of the cabals will favour him. Now that it seems it didn’t favour him as I suspect the party submitted someone else’s name, himself and his boys want to start raising alarm 

It’s too late, sadly! 

Of course, I would have love him to get the ticket as it’s a plus for TASUED.

6/26/22, 1:04 AM - +234 810 619 9957: First and foremost even at 1999 this institution won’t use this kind of letter head paper. Look at the body of the letter  from where u have the word August on an official document like this there shouldn’t be error. If BAT truly attended this university where are his course or school mates that can say one thing or the other abt him either in his set or set before/after him. 

Where is the graduation album cover that shows the list of students that graduated during that year? that album cover started with the white before the idea was taken in Africa here

I mean a black man like BAT been a student of such university I mean during those days spotting BAT won’t be a big deal

6/26/22, 7:06 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Pepper, I think he truly attended that university but his problem is the ‘name change’ from his primary and secondary schools days that made him conceal his true identity.

Remember someone said he has once being jailed before…may be that was the lie he is covering.

I dunno how true but I’ve seen his picture and name numerous times on notable alumni of Chicago State University
6/26/22, 7:10 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Just type Chicago state university notable alumni on Google


But BAT had too many lies put up going there…he might have used a fake secondary school certificate to enter the university sef…


If he used fake O’level, the university might revoke his certificate thereby render him with no uni certificate and thus render APC no presidential aspirant

6/26/22, 7:12 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Na like this dem no allow us hear word when Buhari didn’t see any certificate to present in 2014/2015. They even told us they will vote Buhari even if he present Nepa bill as his certificate 

They have started again. Going up and down to defend Tinubu. 

Seeing educated individuals stoop so low is the saddest of it all
6/26/22, 7:13 AM - +234 810 619 9957: Hmmm if that is the case bro is still good as saying he didn’t attend the school because of fake document now if we say the suppose school revoke his certificate then he shouldn’t be on the alumni list not to talk of a notable list coz there is nothing notable abt fraudulent act. Obviously his educated no doubt bt a man like BAT should know better & ought to have sources for solution before now that is a National isssue
6/26/22, 7:14 AM - +234 810 823 0868: I swear

6/26/22, 7:18 AM - +234 810 619 9957: It appears that way… BAT is an exceptional leader no doubt but circumstances surrounding him might be a problem now most of his followers know all this but their loyalty is unquestionable coz I meet them everyday especially the older ones and yet na BAT dem want
6/26/22, 7:19 AM - +234 810 823 0868: It all about tribe that's all

Make I no cap, na baba Weray BAT be!

He presented himself as ‘primary and secondary school graduate’ in 2003 and he now claims his certificates were stolen when  he was in self exile after NADECO issue.

Where did he see the one he used later in 2003? In law, he has committed PERJURY!

He lied under oath and he should be charged for that!

Asiwaju is Apc member of course but  wasn’t Governor or President, during Massacre at Lekki, according to your logic he should not share in the blame as he’s not to share in the glory of successes. 

Don’t Ronaldinho Me please my leader 🤲🏻😅😂

However, the Gov himself said "Forces beyond him gave the order"...

Loatsad Promomedia is an advertising agency that operate on billboard and own the majority billboard advert in lagos state which include the LEKKI TOLL GATE multimedia advert that I said was "the major light at night at the protest ground in lekki tollgate during endsars protest, that was later turned off the night of the incident".

6/26/22, 5:06 PM - Akotech: I'm glad you understand a bit better now, we are almost here 😆... Lemme balls down a bit.

Before you can ascertain who order the killings, you must start from the root of the operations;

The we will ask ourselves, What are the elements that makes this operation successfully brutal? 

1. The CCTV that was unplugged (Who ordered? The PPP like you rightly said.) 
2. The light that was off (who ordered it? And that can't be done without the approval of the CEO obviously).
3. Where was the barracks of the army who perform the operations (You can identify the personnel there)
4. Who was their commandant (You'll know the where the first order came from)
5. From who was the commandant receive such order from? 

Etc.


If we must take it from the root, we must state from "WHO OFF LIGHT?", if we must start from there, then the advertising company CEO must be held responsible which is who???

She has a life outside endsars

She may have...no...she will definitely have some financial gains for her contribution to endsars but that doesn't make her guilty. Anybody in her position will make money ranging ROM gifts to gigs 

Calling her alatenuje for that sake is hypocrisy

6/27/22, 11:14 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Let me tell you three true stories. Nothing complicated

Someone shared my post without giving me credit as the author. So I visit the wall of the person as well as his inbox to ask to be credited. 

The poster then asked for proof. I referred him to the original post. It took a while and some unnecessary nasty exchanges, but I got the credit.  Now to the first learning. A number of his followers said I should be happy that my post is shared. Why was it important that my name is credited as the author. That what was the big deal. Was the importance not the message? 

By the way, the poster is a religious leader of some sorts so I expect those following him would be of similar persuasion.

Another time, a friend committed a bad act. His spouse informed us of it. This friend is generous and kind to us. Most of us couldn’t tell the friend the truth that he messed up. But one did. He said to our friend “you f..up. “ . Our friend told me one day that he respected that friend more than most. That in him, he would always hear the truth.

The third one. I was driving. A bus drove badly and hit my car. The police came.  The bus passengers were asked for evidence. All supported their driver. A very old woman admonished them. She said to them..”truth should not be coated nor be polished, that their driver was driving like an insane person. That he caused the accident. That they had three near misses before mine”. Her countenance challenged the rest to deny her story. They looked at the ground.

Why have I told you these stories? I have seen many justifying the gaps on an aspirant’s CV. Sounding intelligent in their own minds and splurging nonsense. I feel ashamed for many doing that. I feel a sense of pity for wasting grey matter on nonsense.

You can decide to keep quiet on an issue. You can decide to be mute. Unless you are paid to spin, it is best not to degrade your intelligence for likes. You ruin your person for politicians 

Now, I do think for those supporting Obi that it is best not to waste your energy on such matters. Your focus should be selling your candidate. A defective product does not mean your own becomes preferred. That’s my point.

But to say that gaps are not important or write long epistles is truly beneath many of us.

I am not shading or serving food. Our problem in many instances are the followers.
6/27/22, 11:14 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Apt! 
Very apt!

6/27/22, 8:57 PM - SALAKO💎: *⚜️TAI SOLARIN UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION STUDENTS' UNION⚜️*
*FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER*

*MONDAY 27TH OF JUNE, 2022.*

Dear TASUEDites,

*RE: REPORT ABOUT CONDONEMENT OF ADMISSION FROM 2017-2022 AT JAMB STATE OFFICE IN ABEOKUTA*

You will agree with me that notification about condonement of admission from 2017-2020 was publicized from the above office on Monday 20th of June, 2022 and Thursday 23rd of June, 2022 respectively.

If you gained admission into the prestigious institution Tai Solarin University of Education in the stated year above and you are yet to be admitted by JAMB based on:
i. Not choosing TASUED as first choice which will hinder your JAMB admission letter.

ii. JAMB admitted you with different course of study in TASUED

iii. You did not see JAMB admission letter on your portal at all, and for other reasons. 

You are adviced to make amendment within the short period of time given.

One of the consequences of not being given admission by JAMB is that it will affect mobilization (NYSC) of such students affected at the end of his/her academic pursuit which can hinder graduation. 

With deep consultations done towards this development, kindly be informed that the condonement of admission can only be done at the hosted state of any institution across the federation which there is no stipulated deadline due to the larger percentage of defaulters that are yet to rectify theirs.

Once again, if you fall into this category kindly adhere strictly to making amendment and use this opportunity judiciously.

*DIRECTION*
From anywhere in Abeokuta, take a cab and tell the cab man you are going to the JAMB office.

*NOTE* 
Go along with:
i. JAMB result slip
ii. JAMB slip 
iii. O level result 
iv. Matric no 
v. JAMB login details and
vi. Five thousand naira (5000) cash


With the report gathered so far, if you are informed that your details wasn't forwarded by the institution to JAMB office, kindly check if your name is correctly spelt both on JAMB portal and TASUED portal.

If your name is spelt correct on the duo portals, kindly be patience till NASU call off the strike to rectify such at Admission office.

6/28/22, 6:15 PM - +234 903 224 4825: Opinion! Who am i Voting for? by Babatunde Fashola

BEING THE KEYNOTE LECTURE DELIVERED BY H.E BABATUNDE RAJI FASHOLA, SAN ON THE OCCASION OF THE 6TH ANNUAL BRF GABFEST ON TUESDAY 28TH JUNE 2022

I welcome old and new participants to our 6th edition of the Gabfest. There are many other things you could be all doing instead of being here. So, I am grateful for your participation and I do not take it for granted.

An unquantifiable amount of gratitude must go to all those who expend their valuable time and resources to put this together.

As the years and number of participants have increased, so too I believe have the number of persons involved in planning.

It would be invidious of me therefore to attempt to thank them all individually except to do so by expressing gratitude to the Temple and B-Direct groups and those affiliated with them for the Gabfest.

This year, the GABFEST is modelled around our electoral choices and by extension, our lives over the next few years and the theme is “What am I voting for”?

We have listened to the illuminating contributions of our panelists and I think they deserve commendation for the perspectives they have shared.
What I propose to do is to attempt to tie our votes to what happens to us.

First, I will like to speak about democracy and urge all of us to interrogate our knowledge and understanding of this concept after this gathering has ended.
This is because it is democracy or the idea of it that allows us to talk about voting or better still having a say or making a choice on how our lives are ordered. 

A good starting point is to remind ourselves that democracy is a man-made idea that is not timeless. It is not a divine concept and therefore, it is limited in what it can achieve.

Therefore, democracy can become obsolete, like other things that man has created, unless we renew and re-invent it. But that is a matter for another forum and another day. 

The next thing to say, is to remind ourselves why democracy was created. 

The simple answer is that democracy was created to end tyranny, minority rule and dictatorship. 

It replaced the rule of one person with the rule of many people, now called the majority. It was not concerned about the price of food, access to water or the good life in that sense even though this was a sublime end. The more manifest purpose can be put this way: “You alone as the leader cannot decide for us. We are more than you numerically. We all want a say and we will decide by votes, and agree with the majority.” 

Is the majority always right? I leave you to decide.

Before this becomes a treatise on democracy, let me go to the issue of the day. There is an increasing awareness and mobilisation for registration to get permanent voter’s cards (PVC). 

Before I go on, let me disclose that I belong to a political party, that I am aware that the campaign season has not started and that this programme and what I say are not intended to advance or limit the cause of any political party or their candidate. And I will do my best to keep it that way. 

When the time for campaigns come upon us, I intend to be involved. For now, the question is why are we getting our PVCs and why do we want to vote?

I have heard some people who should know better, say on national TV that: “People are angry, so they must go and get your PVCs and vote.”

Really? Anger is the only reason they offer.

If voting is about a choice about my life and that of my children, will I decide things in my life in anger? Who does that?
Rational and sensible people don’t make choices by anger or in anger. Anger is not a strategy. At best, it is an emotion.

Will you build a house in anger? Take a loan in anger? Marry a spouse in anger? Start a family in anger? Or set up a business in anger? I presume not. So please don’t listen to those closet party supporters or pseudo nationalists. They are more ignorant than you.

Although section 24 of the constitution which sets out duties as citizens of Nigeria does not make voting one of our duties and I think this is a big omission, I think one good reason for which we should vote is that it is a civic responsibility (not duty). Which takes me to the heart of the matter. Now that I know why I got my PVC and I think it is responsible citizenship to vote, “What am I voting for”?

This question is still pertinent because it seems to lie at the heart of the disconnect between the elected and the electorate. I will try to illustrate with a few examples.

Let us start with the most important government – The Local Government.

It may surprise many people when I say it is the most important government because when we talk about human capital development we are talking about the development of the most important resource of any country. This starts from conception and goes on through birth, early education and health care.

I don’t know how many participants at today’s meeting have ever read our constitution and how many who have read it, have read the fourth schedule of the constitution.

If you do, you are likely to agree with me about the importance of the local government, because you will find that it is the local government that is responsible for primary education and primary health.

The Federal Government and by extension the Presidency to whom we often look for the solutions to our problems do not own one primary school or one primary healthcare facility.

It is in these facilities that the foundations of literacy, early education, antenatal care, immunisation for the first five years of a child’s life are undertaken. This is where the odds of a child’s life, whether he or she will survive early childhood diseases and become skilled and productive in future, are determined.

When you add to this, the responsibility of the local government for sanitation, which is the heart of public health, that determines whether your child will be exposed to diseases and fall sick or not, please ask yourself the question posed by the theme of this GABFEST: “What am I voting for?” if you vote at all during local government elections.

Let me quickly conclude this part by letting you know that out of the over 200,000 Km of roads in Nigeria, the Federal government owns 35,000 KM (17.5%); the state government own 31,000 km (17.5%), while the local governments combined own 132,000km (65%).

Therefore, you will see how critical Local Governments are to our mobility, our ability to trade, our ease of doing business and getting things done efficiently.

Put differently, what percentage of people need to move from one state to another daily to earn their livelihood as against the number that need to move from their ward to another to go to school, work and their places of business. 

When you factor the number of people in Nigeria who are traders, you should be interested in the Local Government because the Constitution makes them responsible for markets. 

Let me quickly deal with legislators at state and federal level. Their primary job is to make laws through which policies that will improve our lives are affected.

If you look at the second schedule of the constitution, you will see two parts. Part one contains matters over which federal legislators (House of Representatives and Senate) can make laws. These are the responsibilities of the federal government. This is the Exclusive legislative list. 

Part two contains matters of which both states and the federal government can make laws.

In this part, states are at liberty to go on their own. So, we have state roads, state schools (secondary and tertiary), state hospitals (General and Tertiary).

These are matters over which legislators can make laws at state and federal level. Their other job is to represent us. By this, they bring our problems to the attention of the Executive, at State or Federal level for Executive action to bring about a solution.

Thirdly, they help to check on the Executive to ensure that they do not oppress us, that they use public funds to deliver public goods in the exercise of their oversight responsibility.

It is not their responsibility to build roads, schools, primary healthcare centres, boreholes or supply street lights which we ask them to do in our constituencies.

It is also not their constitutional responsibility to attend our children’s weddings, birthdays or naming ceremonies or provide money for these things. Neither is it their responsibility to provide sewing machines, keke marwa, motorcycles or korope which we demand of them. “So what am I voting for?”

At a recent event at the Yoruba Tennis Club where I delivered a lecture titled “What can the president do for me?”, not a few who expected me to announce a presidential bid seemed disappointed that I did not speak to that matter of their expectation.

I do not know how many recall the contents of my speech about how I tried to show how more important the Governor of my state is to my development than the president of Nigeria.

For example, I pointed out that there is nowhere in the constitution that security is listed as the responsibility of the Federal Government or President alone.

In the second schedule of the constitution where the responsibility of the Federal Government is set only, you will see responsibility for the police, the armed forces etc, which are law enforcement agencies; but you will not see the word 

SECURITY.
If you take a narrow view of what security entails, you might be tempted to conclude that this is only a federal affair.

But if you understand that these, agencies except for the deterrence that they may offer, usually arrive when there is a breach of security. You will see the point that I make that Security is an all-government affair. This is supported by section 14 2(b) of the constitution where the word “Security” is used.

It provides that: “(b) the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government;”

It does not say which government and my view is that it is every government; local, state and federal.

Security therefore involves more than the deployment of armed personnel. It is the effective deployment of socio-economic resources to create a state of harmony. Breaches of security have evolved from conflicts over land, for which the federal government has no responsibility or control, to conflict over natural resources over which the federal government has responsibility and control.

Governors have as much a responsibility to keep us safe. It starts in my view with how they oversee the development of the human capital. This is less of a federal responsibility and more a state one, because people live in states. Where are you voting for?
I have always held the view that in a diverse country where we have elected local government and state leaders, our prosperity will be built from bottom-up and not the other way round.

So in relating this to the choices we make at local, state and federal level, I have often ask people to list five things they want a president to do for them, bearing in mind that since 1999, the honeymoon with our elected presidents have never lasted long.

Some of the five (5) things in no order of preference that often come up are:

SECURITY

I have already spoken about this as a shared responsibility. I believe families who raise their children well, around a sound moral and educational compass can contribute to our collective safety. Afterall, no child was born a criminal or deviant.

ELECTRICITY

Our collective understanding of this utility as a government-only responsibility must change and this in part explains why privatisation of federal government electricity assets took place in 2013. From a staff strength of over 50,000 people, before 2013, the Ministry of Power had only 700 staff when I became minister of power in 2015. The reality we must deal with is that the assets to generate and distribute power has been sold to private businesses. Federal government now only controls the transmission, which is the transport-like side of a supply chain.

Production and distribution are now private businesses. Admittedly FGN is still the regulator and has powers to sanction non-performers.

These are the questions you should be asking any person who wants to be your next president:

A. What are you going to do to make sure that the power transport vehicle does not break down?

B. What are you going to do about the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to make it more efficient?

But please note that responsibility for electricity is not only the federal government alone. By the third alteration to the constitution in 2010, item 14 a, b and c have been added to the concurrent list of the 1999 constitution empowering state governments to generate, transmit and distribute electricity in areas not covered by the national grid. Please ask your governorship candidate what they want to do. 

By the mini grid policy which I initiated, you can now generate your own embedded power under license. Please go to the NERC website for details.

SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS

I think we need to understand that the majority of schools and hospitals do not belong to the local, State and federal governments. They belong to us, private individuals, companies, religious organisations etc, although the government has regulatory oversight of all of them.

Let me share some duties;
UNIVERSITY - 165
STATE - 47
FEDERAL - 43
PRIVATE - 75

In Lagos in 2010 or thereabouts there were 10,001 schools. 1001 were primary schools belonging to the Local Government. 660 were secondary schools belonging to the state government, with Kings College, Queens College and FG College Ijanikin 3 (THREE) Secondary schools belonging to FGN; and University of Lagos and Yaba College of Technology along with Federal College of Education. The remaining over 8300 schools were privately owned. This situation was not too different with the health institutions with about 1000 under our state health facility management register at the time. Federal government owned Igbobi orthopaedic, Federal medical centre Ebute-Metta, LUTH, Idi-Araba and Psychiatric Hospital Yaba, in addition to Military Hospital, Awolowo Road, and a few by other military and paramilitary agencies. Local government had 245 primary facilities and the state government owned 25 General hospitals and LASUTH Ikeja. Meaning over 700 facilities were privately owned.

WATER SUPPLY

It’s true that the Federal Government has a Ministry of Water Resources. But its role is supervisory. To ensure that there is no over-abstraction of water resources from rivers and lakes I wanted to the detriment of others. How that water is pumped to the waterworks, owned by the state, treated to world health standards for consumption and piped to offices and homes, is a state responsibility and not a federal one.

If we understand how critical water is to sanitation hygiene and our lives, we should not only be concerned about what we are voting for but who we are voting for. If you run a business that needs water, this is not the job of a president.

BUSINESS AND JOBS

If your business deals with ports (air and sea), customs and tariffs, these are Federal responsibilities for the president, senators and House of Representatives. So too matters relating to VAT, company tax, interest rates, exchange rate and inflation. They fall under what are categorised as fiscal and monetary policies.

The latter, monetary policy, such as exchange, interest and inflation rates are carried out by the central bank on behalf of the government, because the central bank of Nigeria is owned by the government.

Let me be clear that while the Central Bank of Nigeria can do a lot about how foreign exchanges bought and sold, she can do very little about how much FX is available. This is the function of our productivity export and import. If we earn more, the Central Bank of Nigeria sells more, otherwise the factors of economic exchange such as demand and supply and scarcity take control and determine price. And this takes me to the larger issue of economy and productivity.

The global powerhouse for these are MSMEs in every country of the world. They contribute 50% at least and upwards to employment and growth worldwide. Nigeria has 40 million of these MSMEs ranging from traders, transporters, law firms, accounting firms, dental clinics, estate surveying firms, small factories producing Agro products, water, paint, doors etc. They generally employ between 10 and 200 people at the most and this is where most of us belong. They need land, water, building approvals, have to pay three years rent all at local levels in their states.

What will they be voting for? What will their state legislators and governors offer to make them prosper? How long does it take to get a C of O on a permit to build an office? Can they connect to public water supply and will the state government produce power for them?

So we might wonder how to get candidates to address these issues. One way is to look at what their manifestos present and what their political parties profess. The other way is to attend rallies they organise, but I tell you this is often a one-way conversation because we cannot ask questions at those rallies.

Debates and town hall meetings provide perhaps the best way to put their feet to fire and we as political employers of these public servants can organise these debates and town halls along our economic and social groupings.

In doing so, we must be sensitive, because the candidates cannot attend all debates and Town hall meetings. In some cases we must be willing to accept their accredited spokesperson but this must be an exception and not the rule.

After all they are the ones looking for our votes and we are the ones who seek to employ them.

Now let me go back to the person who said you are angry and should get your PVC in order to vote.

What I did not tell you at the beginning was that he said you must be angry because you don’t have electricity. What he also conveniently did not say was that he participated in the government exercise of selling the Discos and Gencos as an adviser of the Government in 2013. Because of the nature of his job, he was in a position to know, if he did his job well, that some of the people the Discos and some Gencos were sold to were AMCON debtors. What you must know is that AMCON is the acronym for Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria, by which private citizens and companies (about 300 of them) who owed large sums of money running into over Trillions of Naira to our banks, were bailed out with public funds to prevent the banks from collapsing.

Where were these people expected to get the capital to inject into the Discos and Gencos? Deliberately and inadvertently, this person has some responsibility to carry for your lack of power. If it is true that you are angry, he is not fit to advise you how to vote. 

I urge you to vote by holding debates and town halls where you put questions to the candidates to test their abilities. I urge you to vote by looking at what the candidates have done before, this is like asking for the referees during an interview or talking to a previous employer. This is how to recruit an employee. Not by anger.

Thank you for listening.

Presidential Candidate and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has shared his manifesto for the transformation of Nigeria if elected president of the country.

The APC presidential aspirant, according to a press statement signed by Bayo Onanuga, Director of Media and Communication, said his team will lead Nigeria to a new era of economic prosperity, peace, security and political stability. 

Tinubu, the Governor of Lagos State between 1999-2007, presented his vision within five thematic areas.

He promised to improve security by decentralising the policing of the country and creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs simultaneously.

He promised to transform Nigeria into an enviable country and one where there will be justice, peace and prosperity for all, with a “robust economy”.

Titled ‘My Vision for Nigeria’, Tinubu promised in the document, “a nation transformed into greatness, the pride of Africa, a role model for all black people worldwide, and respected among all other countries.

“A vibrant and thriving democracy and a prosperous nation with a fast-growing industrial base, capable of producing the most basic needs of the people and exporting to other countries of the world.

“A country with a robust economy, where prosperity is broadly shared by all irrespective of class, region, and religion.

“A nation where its people enjoy all the basic needs, including a safe and secure environment, abundant food, affordable shelter, health care, and quality primary education for all.

“A nation founded on justice, peace, and prosperity for all.”

On economy, Tinubu promised to build an economy that will make the nation’s Gross Development Product grow quicker annually for the next four years while also providing jobs for millions of youths in the country.

He also promised to launch a new National Industrial Policy focused on special intervention to reinvigorate specific strategic industries.

“I will focus on stimulating jobs, which will be my top priority as President. I will get Nigeria to work by launching a major public works program, a significant and heavy investment in infrastructure, and value-adding manufacturing and agriculture.

“My administration will build an efficient, fast-growing, and well-diversified emerging economy with a real GDP growth averaging 12% annually for the next four years, translating into millions of new jobs during this period,” he said.

Tinubu also promised to create six new Regional Economic Development Agencies which will establish sub-regional industrial hubs to exploit each zone’s competitive advantage and optimise their potential for industrial growth.

The presidential aspirant also promised to formulate a new National Policy on Agriculture to boost food production.

He promised to promote the establishment of new commodity exchange boards, while also strengthening the one in Lagos in order to guarantee minimum pricing for agricultural products such as cotton, cocoa, rice, soya beans, corn, palm kernel, and groundnuts.

On infrastructure, Tinubu promised to “Build A New Nigeria (BANN)” by developing a National Infrastructure plan, which will cover strategic roads, bridges, rail, water, power, seaports, and airports spanning the length and breadth of the country.

He said his administration will combine government funding, borrowing, public private partnership, private sector financing and concession to initiate a medium and long-term financial model for the BANN initiative.

Tinubu further stated that his administration will target an electricity distribution goal of 15,000 megawatts across the country and ensure a sustainable 24/7 supply.

“On Electricity, I will embark on a renewed action-oriented focus and take immediate and urgent action on resolving existing challenges of power generation plants, gas purchasing, pricing, transmission, and distribution. My administration’s critical goal is to have 15,000 megawatts distributable to all categories of consumers nationwide to ensure 24/7 sustainable supply within the next four years,” he added.

On the oil and gas sector, Tinubu said there will be no need for a subsidy because the market will be open and transparent.

“Supply will come from local refineries, and the forces of demand and supply will determine the price of petroleum products”.

My administration will establish a National Strategic Reserve for Petroleum Products to stabilize supply during unexpected shortages or surplus periods. This will eliminate any form of product shortages and prevent wild swings in prices.

Tinubu also spoke about his administrations promise in the area of education, promising to increase the spending on education to 25 per cent of the nation’s budget. 

He promised to continue the free school feeding programme of the APC, feeding “millions of primary school children across the country”.

On tertiary education, Tinubu said his administration eradicate strikes by tertiary institution workers by encouraging the tertiary institutions to source for funds through grants and corporate sponsorships, with all the institutions granted financial autonomy.

Just like education, Tinubu also promised to increase the funding for health care in the annual budget to 10 per cent. According to him the National Health Insurance Scheme will be relaunched to grant health insurance cover to most Nigerians.

6/30/22, 9:45 AM - Akotech: Ridiculed him for what he's guilty about actually.

I was posted to KOGI for NYSC, I thank God the camp didn't conclude before we japa! That state be like an abandoned state, I was robbed almost twice feeling helpless, public transit always be on the run despite bad road so no one could cross them.

When they mistakenly posted me to a PPA (me that that I've seen LAGOS for my portal already 😆), when I went to that school, they asked for what they could offer us, I said 15-20k per month, mama said even most civil servant dont collect 20k and she literally showed me her last SALARY, baba that madam dey collect N11,200/month.. That amount no fit common for my head, she even said that they're some who collect lower.. I just turned back and said " I'll get back to you ma'am" and I never return... The last time the madam called me, I don dey LAG 😆..

Those KOGI people dey suffer low key, no bike man and local citizens ever say good about YAYA, they didn't want him but they claimed he force himself and his candidates on them with thugs, gunmen and power threat. They lament daily trust me.

How many towns or villages did you enter within your stay in camp?

Katsina State camp is one of the most beautiful camps you can see in this country, I'm sure it's better than Lagos camp tho, situated in a very nice environment too.
All the SAED halls have dope ACs 😂🤣 (I'm sure of our time tho and Emmy can bear me witness.
Despite the beautiful camp, Katsina is the craziest place i have been to all my life. The few good things there were built by Yar Adua.
6/30/22, 9:57 AM - Akotech: You see that Hospital he recently showcase on social media yeah, do you know the location of that hospital 😆... ill tell you categorically that random people can't use that hospital, soon they'll start coming up to speak up! Make I no talk.. Yaya was so worst that he go after people who make negative comment about him on social media and stays in KOGI, I was shocked when most people within the state confirmed that 😆, I'll hardly see any kogite tackling YAHAYA openly, even civil servant and kings no get the liver. 😆 


I hope you see a video where his wife was sharing 1million each for security men and house personnel??? While the state owe lot of civil servant months of salary despite poor payment??? 

They said he claimed that KOGI state is poor and can't afford to pay some salary so they have to cut it short! The same man that bought 100million presidential form, willing to pay delegates and even ready to spend billions on elections 😆.

You see, these people priorities really differs to what we thought it was.

6/30/22, 10:07 AM - +234 703 446 8168: @2348090955503 is right about him, KOGI state has been a black and white picture of the 50s before him.

Yahaya’s first term was outright flop!
Even El RUFAI confirmed it during campaign…he said something like “he agrees GYB messed up the first term that he is sure that he’s learnt his lessons and will do better.”

@2348164636464, you would agree with me that  infrastructure is a great thing but it doesn’t solve economic problem effective immediately but it does in the long run and with proper maintenance.

The hospitals he built and refurbished are not there to solve economic problems 💯 but majorly health problems associated with the common man!

On affordability, those hospitals are not private, they are state owned hospitals (GENERAL HOSPITAL) with modern facilities.

1. On the camp where I served they're lot of KOGI indigene and none ever say good about YAHAYA ( as a platoon leader [before i faked sickness to resign because of wahala 😆 ], you know I should have a lot of interactions with my people).
2. The hotel I lodge, all the staff didn't say a bit good about this man 
3. I have guys who never redeployed and share how horrible the experience was .

You cant tell me all these people dont know KOGI too now.. 

And most importantly, how well do you want me to know a damage state where a CIVIL SERVANT can gallantly show me how underpay there being paid??? How their salary don't even enter on time despite low pay etc.

Common now 😆, and you have to take this from me because I'm more of an insider of KOGI state than you baba (I served there, I have people who served there, I've had conversations with people here, I've experience horrible robbing experience there) I believe I can say more than you do... 

This is beyond social media 💯💯💯

6/30/22, 11:01 AM - +234 813 288 6674: I'm not speaking for Kogi or her Governor.
My point is people claiming Yahaya didn't do anything doesn't mean he didn't do anything per say.

I have a friend that told me Kano is better than Lagos, I argued with him. And he took me round the city for 3 days to prove his points.

Bello is bad, he's better than Dapo, that was my point initially.
6/30/22, 11:03 AM - Akotech: At least DAPO isn't payment workers 11,200 😆... 

I rest my case!
6/30/22, 11:06 AM - +234 905 302 0945: Also have you asked me to take you to the cardinal point of DAPO projects in OGUN state.

 If you are the father of this child, what will you do?

6/30/22, 7:18 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Hello Ifedayo,

How have you been? I hope you are doing fine and doing your best to cope with the everyday pressures of life? Although life cannot ever be totally free from troubles, we continue to work daily to ensure that we make the journey more stress-free for the good people of Oyo State.

To celebrate newsletter no 40, I want to talk about something that happened recently that convinced me that I made the right choice to persevere in my bid to be elected the Governor of Oyo State.
On Thursday, June 23, 2022, I got what I would describe as an emotional and touching visit from Madam Okunlola Eunice Olaninhun.

Madam Olaninhun is a widowed retiree from the Oyo State civil service. She retired nine years ago in 2013, but that was a time in our history when the needs of retirees were not prioritised. Because her husband died before his gratuity was paid, she made a promise, then, that if she ever received her gratuity in her lifetime in good health, she would give 10% to God and 1% to whoever is in government that facilitated the payment. Last week, she came to redeem her pledge of N30,495.00.

Madam Olaninhun’s visit will go down as one of the most touching moments for me as the Governor of Oyo State. Of course, I knew that our policies and programmes were making an impact on people’s lives in general. But to have someone so directly affected visit and say the things she said was overwhelmingly humbling. It motivates me to do even more.

I wanted to use this newsletter to openly acknowledge her for the part she has played in reassuring me that all our sacrifices are worth the effort. I believe that God used her to pass a message to me. And so, in those quiet moments when I ask myself if I should have remained in the private sector and continued to do the little I could in that corner, I will remember Madam Okunlola Eunice Olaninhun and say to myself, “you did the right thing in putting yourself forward to serve the good people of Oyo State”.

Let me stop here now, and go back to the business of ensuring that we continue to create the right environment for the good people of Oyo State to flourish and be blessed.

Talk to you again soon.

She is calm.

People are watching.

All of us are at this popular bukateria style eatery in Lekki Phase 1.

"... it is your cashier that made the mistake."

"No sir, it is two of you."

"What are you talking about?"

"Yes, she typed in the wrong amount for your food, but when she gave you the P.O.S you should have seen it."

"I was on my phone!"

"It is not our fault that you didn't cross check."

"Is that what you are saying?"

"Sir, I have said that we are sorry."

"Don't be sorry, give me a refund."

"Sir, look at the walls, it is written there that we don't do refunds."

"I bought food of N4,880 and your cashier put N488,000 and you are telling me I won't get a refund?"

"It is company policy."

"What stupid company policy. I want my money."

"Sir, it is not possible."

"I want to speak to your manager or whoever runs this place."

"I am in charge here, sir."

"You are not speaking like someone in charge, let me speak to the owner then."

"I am sorry, sir, that will not be possible."

"Don't tell me that! I want to speak to the person that can refund me my money..."

"Sir, the best thing we can do for you is open an account for you and as you are coming to eat here we will be deducting it until you finish eating the money..."

6/30/22, 9:07 PM - +234 701 493 3022: 2023: Sowore Announces Lawyer, Haruna, As Running Mate, Says AAC Will Defeat APC, PDP, Others 

The Presidential Candidate of African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore has officially announced a lawyer, Haruna Garba Magashi as his running mate.

Sowore made the announcement on Thursday in Abuja.

The Vice Presidential candidate of the AAC is from Kano State.

According to Sowore, Magashi has all it takes to deliver Kano for the AAC in the 2023 presidential election.

“We hope to defeat APC (All Progressives Congress) over there because the governor has messed up; we know that we will defeat PDP (Peoples Democratic Party), that’s the party that’s in crisis as we speak. 

"We don’t need to talk about the Labour Party in Kano because the party doesn’t exist,” the AAC candidate said.

“We know that we will defeat Alhaji Kwankawso and his party, the NNPP (New Nigeria Peoples Party) in Kano because we have got someone who is from there.”

The AAC had earlier submitted Magashi’s name to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

I wanted to get a new SIM to complement the one I already have. Then I decided to patronise a road side sim vendor and the unexpected happened. 
During registration, I gave out the needed details to the vendor and the registration was going on smoothly until it got to capturing Usually, you are expected to be captured once but the vendor captured me twice and that made me suspicious. So I queried him but he gave a flimsy excuse.
Immediately after the registration, I got a welcome text message indicating I registered two numbers instead of one and I asked why two numbers registered in my name instead of one, the vendor said "it's normal, that sometimes the issue is from the network operators”. 
The next day, I went to Glo office to lay a complain and the moment I mentioned what brought me, the manager there said "these guys again? Why doing these to innocent people"?, that was when I realized the gravity of what just happened. The second number was deregistered, the case was reported and the guy was picked up. Questioning the vendor, he said they usually use people's details to register other sim cards which they resell to "car trackers" at a higher price. 
On further interrogation, he confessed that he uses people's details to register sim cards which they sell to fraudsters, ritualists, kidnappers and he makes a lot of money from the business.
Now, imagine if he sold this second number to a kidnapper or a fraudster and when tracked, my picture and details would pop up and it would be difficult to deny. I'm putting this out here because a lot of innocent people are in prisons today because of cr!me they know nothing about.
While doing your registration, please be attentive and report any suspicion to the right authority.
Forwarded as received.

No?

Relax, you will soon have. Many sef! It may even be you.

50 million able-bodied men will be recruited or conscripted into the army. 

That is one out of every four.
Hold your family meeting and decide who will join if Someone wins 2023 election. 

Females get equal status.

I just said I should tell you well ahead.

 Choose your battles wisely, your enemies even more so.

7/1/22, 7:21 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Oh good
7/1/22, 7:21 PM - +234 903 224 4825: Ever since I grow up, since I can identify the right from left, good and bad, nobody or group of persons has ever successfully recruited me into their sentiment about a person or a situation. Nobody! 

I am a product of many factors. And very truthfully, many contributed to my today's feats. In retrospect, I've never been ungrateful to those individuals. I have always mount up to develop myself too to be better of. I have respectfully payed back in humble return and appreciation. However, today is gainful. My yesterday is historic too. I have continue to apply the lessons of yesterday in my today and results have been coming in. 

I've never been "used" by anyone or group of people. I am grownup. I'm above 18. I'm a growing adult. I am responsible for the decision I've taken in the past, the ones I take at moment and those I'll take tomorrow. For no reason should anyone believe I live under any illusion. 

Whoever I have supported in the past, whatever decision I have taken, whichever side I have glued myself to are willing choice from me and not influenced by anybody. We could have supported a same stand in the past, but we definitely have different reasons for doing so. Again and affirmatively, no one has ever successfully recruited me into their resentment of another or others ever since I'm grown up. 

I'm not arrogant. I have always and will continue to be open to mentorship and right guidance. Right, ideal, sane and progressive ones. 

I don't and won't disguise to please anyone. And I'll not allow myself to be cowed. To best of my ability, I have always been respectful, humble and pay due homage to elders or senior ones I believe I owe an entitlement of honour. No-one should thus take that advantage and mess up with my intellect and humility. 

I have a life I'm living and to live further. As a matter of fact, I am living it already. I have a lifestyle. I have a dream. I have goals that I pursue. I have visions. And nobody is capable of distracting me from achieving them. 

I am a religious being, a conscious Muslim. And I understand the concept of relationship and conscience. I won't be a party to any inordinate situation or conspiracy at anyone, target at anybody whatsoever. I have always resist it and I'll continue to. I won't take a decision or be a part of such, that, I will in a later time regret or feel embarrassed about. No! 

I have a life filled with purpose, I should please be excused and exonerated from anything that do not conform with my beliefs. Please. 

Thanks and God bless!

The Northern governors already wrote ZULUM to be BAT’s running mate!

Weray ni APC yenn, it would have been easier if it were PYO & ZULUM on the ticket!

However, ZULUM as a choice further positions APC closer to Aso Rock!

PO will be a stiff candidate to beat in the North if he is able to bring KWANKWASO as his running mate.

E go turn GAME ON!


•• ATIKU would have been a man to beat if he had picked WIKE but now, only a reconciliation will salvage what is perceived as colossal damage!

You can never truly be convinced that she's the one until you knack & you still feel you need her.

Even those that don't knack before marriage.

How you see her after knacking is far better than how you feel before knacks.

7/2/22, 10:17 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Anything from PDP will always be a threat nationally!

I’m not writing him off!

I’m only visualising Zulum from NE, same region as Atiku…

can Atiku defeat Zulum in that zone?
The only difference and margin in favour of ATiku in that zone is AA is running for president and the other is running as VP!

Atiku will need the support of WIKE in SS to reconcile with the likely to be closed margin in the NE.

Meanwhile, North West & partially NC remain the decider of the poll!

7/2/22, 8:04 PM - +234 906 762 1398: The attack in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State is a direct assault on Nigeria, which will not go unpunished. We honour our security forces, and particularly those brave souls who have given their lives fighting the evil that is terrorism.

Sadly, Nigeria’s fight against terrorism continues. It is a battle that is taking its toll on all of us. But we shall not relent, nor shall we surrender.

We say it again that we have reduced Boko Haram to a shell of its former self. But terrorists are parasites. They thrive when the world is suffering.

This atrocity only serves to further strengthen us against them. Nigeria is united in obliterating these demons. Each day we grow closer to that goal. When they lash out during times of global suffering, it is the act of a cornered animal, an act of desperation.

As always, their goal is the same: to sow fear and division amongst us. We will not let them.

Instead let us pray for the families and loved ones of those who sacrificed their lives in the fight against evil, and let us pray for the safe and speedy return of those abducted. We will do everything possible to ensure their return.

And to the sadists, I say this: we are coming. No matter what rock you crawl under, what hole you sink into, what lie you hide behind, we are coming and we will find you. Shiroro will see justice. Nigeria will know peace.

7/3/22, 2:07 PM - +234 817 014 8364: I disagree..

Money is involved.

It helps keep d structure which are the people.

People are structures.

Major parties have their membership rooted even in streets (unit) and this units have people who work to keep hold of those units and mobilize more..

Some units/wards even have offices in some communities etc

So money is no structure but it helps keep d structure.

Same way we have our structures in tradition. E.g, In Cosit, I was the first Tradition president,after which we never looked back. With the help of many and my speaker then, we were able to nurture people in all depts and planted their root firmly, that cosit structure is what we still enjoy today. Yes, little money and time played part too.

I know how many puff puff I dey buy daily then. 😂

7/3/22, 6:51 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): One of my university mate risked it all to write exam for his then gf, he was caught by a lecturer he was close to.

He was in his final yr & so the lecturer didn't want him expelled, the lecturer punished him by deliberately failing him in 2 of his own courses. 

Gf graduated.

My guy couldn't pass the courses & had 2 extra yrs.

He was still in sch when the gf left for service.

He was still in that same sch when the gf told him that she was getting married.

He was still in the same sch, she got married & had her honeymoon in Seychelles.

End.

Instead of you to invest in your own education to improve your status, you waste that money to invest in another woman's education because she "loves" you.

When you're done, she'll tell you that she can't marry a high school graduate.

7/3/22, 8:25 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Alcohol dosent enhance sex performance, it intoxicates affecting the brain that’s why some folks experience slurred speech when high. For sex performance the best is to remain natural eat fruits, nuts, reduce sugar intake and engage in exercise. Sex energizers as side effect so I don’t advise anyone to patronize it cause when u can’t do without them it becomes addiction and is even more dangerous…

Every actions comes with its consequences either good, bad, right or wrong.

The tape is already in the Public Domain since God knows when and from what I observed, the followers of the handler enjoyed every bit of it....

Also, no one here knows the person behind the page *Casted Raw* that we would have reach out to him/her to pull it down....

When issues are brought here, we shouldn't results to attacks of people personality and cruel use of words. 

This is a platform where friendship and knowledge is shared. I expect us all to abide by the rules of friendship and not resolve to spewing hate.

Most importantly, there's difference between cruise, disrespect and being rude.

Every persons involved should sheath their sword and embrace peace.

All this grammar because an adult who is well in his mid 30s acted porn!

Is porn video not supposed to be watched or not supposed to be viral??

Make una leave the guy, Abeg!

He said na sapa push an der, now he no dey SAPA-CHESTER United again abi?

Sapa hold am, E no sabi where dem dey go carry PONPON for site abi he no sabi market way go dey carry alabaru??

Isn’t it bad enough to be a YAHOO BOY than downgrading to being a PORN ARTIST?

A yahoo boy will still be scared of his nude in public let alone his sex tape…anybody who chooses porn already made the decision to damn the consequences!

Cos we know Lawi now, we should help him bring down the link by contacting the owner of the CASTED RAW to bring down the video…

So if he asks us to pay a certain million naira to bring it down cos it’s his business, all of us go come contribute am?

Abeg, make we respect the gentleman’s opinion and watch his porn in peace!

If we still have people considering it as an alternative, JUST KNOW AT THE MOMENT THAT IT’S NOT YOUR BEST OPTION TO GETTING FINANCIALLY STABLE…

But in the end you choose it, we will watch and help you share with your kinsmen!

The day anybody get arrested here for illegal deals, I Onipede Ibrahim Olawale will drag his/her right here and use the person as an example for others to desist from such.....

PS: *Kindly use the same energy if I am ever found wanting of any illegal act*

There's dignity in Labour and I hold it in high esteem.....

@2348163162679 this is just to buttress my point that *"the day a yahoo boy here is being arrested, his the day we say it to his face to bear the consequences"*

A good number of us here are in relationships whether as friends or families with yahoo boys.

So, the energy we had in joking about Lawi acting porn that is illegal is supposed to be channelled towards every other illegal stuff nAh.

But you see yahoo, whether consciously or unconsciously, the society is normalising being around them!

7/5/22, 8:16 AM - +234 810 619 9957: There is a strong correlation between poverty and cognition/ability to make good decisions. I think that is one of the reasons why some Nigerians are still supporting and defending the very same persons who have looted and continue to loot public money, kept them poor and hungry, and kept the country they claim to love undeveloped and decaying. Other reason is tribal and religious sentiments but like this young man said, I AM NOT IGBO, HAUSA OR YORUBA. I AM A NIGERIAN. Choose competence this time around. We MUST save Nigeria

A Nigerian in France said this…..
7/5/22, 8:38 AM - +234 816 463 6464: *"Choose competent this time around"*

7/7/22, 7:45 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): AKWA IBOM GUNMEN ATTACK NYSC LODGE, ROB, RAPE WOMEN:        A REBUTTAL

The attention of the Management of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Akwa lbom State has been drawn to an online publication, with the above caption, published by Punch online and reported by several online media. 

In the said story making the rounds, it was alleged that Gunmen attacked, raped, robbed and dispossessed Corps members of their valuables at Udo Ekong Ekwere Street, off Information Drive, Uyo, Akw Ibom State where they reside.

To put the unfortunate incident in proper perspective, the State Coordinator, NYSC Akwa Ibom State, Mrs. Chinyere Ekwe in company of the State Police Commissioner, Mr. Olatoye Durosinmi, visited the Corps members for an on the spot assessment.

 While there, it was confirmed that 21 Corps members occupy the said property. The interaction with the Corps members further revealed that an attack on them was actually carried out by thieves at about 1am this morning. 

In the process, the invaders took their valuables including phones, Laptops and some cash. They confirmed that NO bodily harm was meted on them, and NO CORPS MEMBER WAS RAPED.
 
While the actions and intentions of those criminal elements remained condemnable, we passionately appeal to the social media operators, particularly, Punch online, to exercise restraint and not trivialize such unfortunate incident as the consequences on the psychology of parents and guardians of Corps members in the state would be dangerously affected. 

However, it is worthy of note that the State Commissioner of Police has assured the Corps members and members of the public that an investigation on the matter has been launched and that the culprits will soon be apprehended. 

Meanwhile, the Commissioner has equally detailed surveillance around the area with a promise to extend same to other Corps lodges. 

Accordingly, the State Coordinator in the State has reaffirmed that there was no incident of rape. She therefore urges the Corps members in the State to go about their lawful duties and make use of the security phone lines already provided, while in distressed situations.

 Thank you.
                  
  Ekwe, Chinyere NI (Mrs)
          State Coordinator

Among the residents are PDP,  APC, Bubuists and some who don't even bother with labels or voting. The Bubuists won in 2015 and 2019. They're here as fellow residents...also wailing. 
They voted for one who was electable. One with structure. They voted a winner. But they're suffering like everyone else.

7/7/22, 9:52 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Dayo and Rukayat Studied Engineering at a  University in kwara State. They were both Classmates and after Five years of Studying hard, they both graduated. After graduation, Fate took them through different paths of life. 

5 Years later, Rukayat after much frustration of securing a job, ended up as a Secretary in a Building firm earning 50,000 Naira monthly. 

Meanwhile, Dayo on the other hand, couldn't Secure a Job and ended up a Taxi Driver, He makes At least 5,000 daily and if he works for only 20 days in a month, He makes 100,000 Naira that month.

One Evening, Rukayat closed from work and was at the bus stop waiting for taxi when Dayo stopped. She hopped in when she discovered the taxi was going her way but little did she know it was Dayo. All through the journey, she was lost in her Phone. 

She reached her bus Stop and after alighting, just when she was about paying, she took a look at the driver and their eyes met, wow! They were both happy. 

"Is this you?" they both asked themselves simultaneously as if they planned it. Rukayat gave him money but Dayo insisted she keep it. He was happy to see her and for old time sake, he left the money for her even when she insisted that she wanted to pay. They both exchanged contact and left. 

Well, Rukayat went home that night and was lost in thought. Not as if Dayo was looking bad but Dayo driving Taxi? She couldn't wrap her head around it. She Pitied him. Felt Sorry for him. If Dayo had allowed her she would have paid him and beg him to keep the change. 

Little did she know that, Dayo actually has another Taxi running for him, He is a Land owner and he is planning on developing it soon. But because he was driving a Taxi, She felt Pity for him.

On the other hand, Dayo felt sorry for himself too. Before he slept that night, he remembered Rukayat, how neatly she dressed and nice she smells, "She must be earning over 300,000 Naira per month" he said to himself. He felt ashamed, He felt like a failure and he felt she was way ahead of him financially and otherwise. 

Little did he know that, If Rukayat removes the transportation fare and feeding money from her monthly salary, it will take her at least 3 Months to earn what he earns monthly. 

Sadly, this could be some of our reality, you measure your progress and success with that of your friends, Classmates and Relatives even with very limited information you have about them. 

You think yours is worse because you look dirtier, you think yours is worse because you are not on Corporate wears, you think yours is worse because the other person acts and looks Nicer. 

Stay Focused and Face your life. It's not a competition. Stop Comparing things, you don't have the full picture. Every one is running on his own lane. Be contented.

Be focused👌.

The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs website hosues the correct information and explanation on this new policy, you can check. 

So, it is grossly incorrect to draw this false narrative or try and pin this on Nigeria alone.

7/8/22, 11:36 AM - +234 808 351 8616: A SEASON OF LAST SUPPERS

The one found guilty under cross examination may escape his due recompense of hanging on the tree as an accursed thing on one condition, that is, if he can secure a sheepish self-righteous traitor in the mold of the famed biblical character, Judas Iscariot, to offer as his Passover Lamb. While the sheepishly self-righteous hangs on the tree to fulfill all the righteous requirement of the law, the identity of the one that he dies in his stead gets crossed over. In other words, the criminal’s status and the label goes with it dies on the cross. He is thereby resurrected from the dead, with a new identity, a hidden sacred name that must remain hidden to everyone other than himself.

The moral of this story is simple: Be mindful of whose bread and wine you are ingesting, especially in this season that politicians are calling out to their disciples to be at their “last supper.”

As a grown up I am, I can slaughter ram for sallah, the question is who am I replacing the ram with?

Absolutely no one✌️
7/8/22, 1:50 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): If God didn’t not reveal it to him at the late hour that it was just a test of faith, he would kill his son

Would Muslims around the world today be ready to do so too?
7/8/22, 1:52 PM - +234 813 948 8163: They won’t. Cos they didn’t promise God their first sons. 

Like I said, we are only doing the ram sacrifice to mark his strong faith and cos Allah has ordained us to do such.

*HAPPY EID - EL- KABIR TO MUSLIM UMAH*

*As we know, the feast of sacrifice dates back from the historic event when Prophet Ibraham was commanded by God, in a dream, to sacrifice his son, Ismail. While he was in the act of sacrificing his son, God sent the Arch Angel Gabriel with a huge ram as ransome.*

*Gabriel informed Ibrahim that his convenant was fulfilled and instructed him to sacrifice the ram as a ransom for his son. Muslims observe the ritual as a way of acknowledging that only Allah has the absolute right to take a life and that they do so as a humble member of Allah’s creation in need of food. Above all, it shows the spiritual committment to the covenant with Allah and absolute submission to His will at all times, in times of pain and joy.*

7/9/22, 5:44 PM - +234 814 235 8262: "Nigerians don't hate oppression, they just don't want to be the victim."

My American friend will say "half and half is true."

This is the case with the above statement.

First off, I'll start with Damini Ogulu, the wretch of a human known as Burna Boy. A perfect example of poor parenting and oppression.

In 2020 when the air of the Protest was still brewing, Damini mocked Nigerians about not being able to protest against oppression. Said a lot of unrefined things, charging up like he wanted to lead a protest but Nigerians aren't ready for the call and so was dulling the freedom fighter in him.

Immediately Runtown ignited the fire of the Protest and Nigerians in every city was protesting, Damini was no where to be found.

He went to hide under his Momma's bed and nothing was ever heard of the self acclaimed Fela incarnate, self acclaimed African Giant.

Damini was dwarved in the face of walking the talk. So much for being the Giant, Twice as tall.

Today, we pretend that we do not know that some couple of weeks ago, this denigrate soul made a pass at another man's wife, and when the woman declined his move, Damini ordered his Policemen to deal with the woman's husband and their friends resulting in shootings and serious injuries.

Three hours after this incident, Damini jetted off to Barcelona.

No statements from his mother who doubles as his manager, nor from him, nor any further investigations conducted.

This is the same police brutality that Damini Ogulu rubbished Nobel Nigerian youths of being incapable of protesting against.

Damini resorted in using the police to oppress people.

Just few days ago, he dropped an Album and Stan culture, the same guys that went hard on DBanj, RKelly, and Tuface, have all gone bunkers with his album and it seems they've silenced the fact that he almost killed a man because he couldn't have his wife.

In a sane society, Damini would have been extradited back to the country and made to facs his crime, but the current Nigeria is not a real place.

"Nigerians don't hate oppression, they just don't want to be the victim."

Here is my thought on the whole thing.

We are all hypocrites.

Every single one of us. Myself inclusive when I am in my human element. You all stinking of it.

From the Pastor who keeps giving us fake integrity around but sleeps with his secretary and finds an excuse to lay her off when he is done with her, to the Politicians who has lost shame and integrity and is shamelessly sodomizing us.

From the Christian who believes that shrines should be burned down because the worshippers of indigenous African faith are not worshipping the living God's where as it is persecution when terrorists burn a Church, and kill worshippers 

From Reno Omokri and his useless nuggets that aimed at taking another person's twitter account down, but cries foul when he's is reported, to all of you who reported his accounts but still stereotype people.

All of you are hypocrites.

We all are band of hypocrites.

The earlier we stopped pretending to be flawless, the earlier we became aligned to our true selves — a selfish, opportunistic, egomaniacs, who are trying to be flawless when we can actually be the demons we are in our true nature and have demon hunters chase us and takes us down.

My two cents.

You can decide to listen the Spirits this morning or not.

7/10/22, 11:22 AM - +234 903 224 4825: BUHARI's LEGACY: SEPARATING THE WHEAT FROM THE CHAFF

Dr Uche Diala 

RESTRUCTURING

'Restructuring' has being a buzz word in Nigeria, heightened since 2015; mouthed by the informed and uninformed; sincere and insincere alike. There has been unrelenting criticisms and even blackmail of President Muhammadu Buhari and his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) over its stance and constitutional provision on the issue of restructuring by the party. 

In June, 2021, the Nigerians in the Diaspora Organization, Americas (NIDOA), USA, wrote to President Buhari among a potpourri of issues; some from mere hearsay and clearly out of touch with realities and truths on ground; requesting he works towards true federalism.

Never mind that President Buhari has repeatedly stated his commitment to restructuring and that only the National Assembly can tackle issues relating to restructuring, true federalism or devolution of powers. Surely that is true.

Specifically, on June 11, 2021, when he received members of the Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) led by Co-Chairmen, Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar and President of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), His Eminence, Rev. Dr. Samson Supo Ayokunle, at the State House, Abuja the President stated thus:

“On the contentious issue of restructuring or true federalism or devolution of powers, as you all know, this is a constitutional matter with which only the National Assembly can deal.

“I remain an unapologetic believer in devolving power to the people and that is why I signed the Executive Order granting autonomy to State Legislature and Judiciary. Unfortunately, this was met with some resistance at the state level and led to a more than two months strike action that has cost the country a lot of pain.

“Luckily the National Assembly has nearly completed the constitutional review process, which I hope would address some of the burning issues agitating the minds of our people.’’

In spite of all that, what practical effort did or has President Buhari made to implement restructuring; whatever it means to different people? If Any.

It is on record; whether acknowledged or not that President Buhari has at least made an attempt at practical 'restructuring'; if a critical part of restructuring is devolution of powers which is essentially reducing the powers and duties of the centre and making federating units truly autonomous, more functional, progressive and self sustaining.

Executive Order No. 10 signed into law by President Buhari on May 22, 2020, aimed at granting financial autonomy to State legislatures and judiciary but State governors in a bipartisan and rarely united and swift manner sabotaged that effort at restructuring Nigeria by the Buhari Administration; at least for a start or in part.

To put the matter in perspective, the Buhari APC-led Federal Government in 2019 introduced Executive Order No. 10 to correct the wrong being committed by the State Governors and breathe new life into the third tier of government in Nigeria, which ought to be the most important tier.

It also introduced through the Nigeria Financial Investigation Unit (NFIU); a set of guidelines to ensure that state Governors would no longer withdraw monies meant for local council operations from the Joint Account (Section 162 (8). Note that this unwholesome practice by state Governors is one of the major reasons the local government level of government is virtually dead across board.

The Governors of the 36 states of the Federation kicked against Executive Order 10 as an abbreviation of their rights under the 1999 Constitution and collectively went to court, and hence asked the Court:

(a) to declare the Executive Order 10, unconstitutional and illegal; 

(b) compel the Federal Government to take up funding of capital projects for State High Courts, Sharia Court of Appeal and Customary Court of Appeal, and 

(c) refund to the 36 states a sum of N66 billion, being amount which they claimed to have spent on capital projects for the three courts in their respective states. 

The Supreme Court of Nigeria in a split decision on February 11, 2022 voted 6-1 to nullify Executive Order 10 through which the Federal Government of Nigeria had sought in 2019, to give effect to Section 81 (3) and Section 121(3) of the 1999 Constitution, as altered by the 4th Alteration Act No. 4 of 2017, with regard to the financial autonomy of state judiciary and legislature which had been observed more in the breach by state governments and their Chief Executives. 

Citing the rule of law, separation of powers, the limits of powers and the federal principle, the Supreme Court ruled that the Executive Order 10 is ultra vires, unconstitutional, illegal, and therefore null, void and of no effect whatsoever. 

While the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land and it has shut down that ingenious, patriotic and bold move by President Buhari, it does not vitiate the fact that he tried and we must charitable, objective, factual, fair and sincere; even if we do not like the man for any reason.

Imagine that that move which was well supported and hailed by well meaning Nigerians succeeded? What practical filip it would have given to our restructuring quest. What good it would have done for Nigeria. But we just love impressionist talks.

Some could say Buhari should go the constitutional ammendment route which by the way is in agreement with his restated stance that restructuring falls on the desk of the National Assembly. But he knew where that would and has led to - nowhere and that was why he tried that alternative route for our collective benefit. Was it not the same Houses of Assembly that once voted down a constitutional ammendment proposal for autonomy of the state legislature? Their own autonomy. 

Why are we not able to understand that the Legislature (National Assembly) is equally a very important arm of government and hold it equally accountable as the Executive?

I keep cautioning on the need for proper, accurate and objective study, understanding and appreciation of what have been done and what is being done by the current administration devoid of unbridled emotions. So that whoever we support to get there in 2023 will know where and how to start so as not to go on merry go rounds to our collective detriment.

I sincerely pray for our sakes and that of our nation that we do not sell our dog to buy a pussy cat. Because then it is the same four-legged animal we will still have or worse.

#GodBlessNigeria

7/10/22, 6:07 PM - +234 906 762 1398: Statement by Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Presidential Flag Bearer of the All Progressives Congress on his Choice of the Vice Presidential Candidate. July 10, 2022. 

1. Fellow Nigerians, we enter a moment of renewed hope. We hold the chance to move the nation and our collective cause forward as never before. Let us seize this moment so that history may write kindly of us.  
2. It is time to focus with utmost devotion and love of country to do all we can do to advance the ideals of democratic and progressive good governance in the land. 
3. We must end poverty and bring greater prosperity and more lasting peace. Let us be wise of thought yet courageous in action, as we embark on a collective enterprise that brings jobs, education, food, medicine, hope and belief in a better life to those who need them. 
4. I stand ready to begin this journey with you, hopefully, to lead the nation on this needed path as your next President by the grace of God. I believe this is a pivotal moment at which the dynamics of history and destiny call us forth to reshape our beloved nation. This is our moment. 
5. We all must answer the nation’s call. For some, this requires of us that we step forward, assuming new roles and responsibilities. For others, it may mean something else. For all of us, it requires that we dedicate ourselves to the collective national task as never before.   
6. To re-envision and reshape the nation, I must compose the best team possible, a team put together with but one overriding purpose: to forever establish just, capable, and compassionate governance for the people of Nigeria without regard to religion, region, or ethnic origin.  
7. In the weeks since becoming the presidential candidate and standard-bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC), I have been touched as Nigerians from all walks of life have demonstrated their faith in my capacity to lead this country. I thank you for the outpourings of support for they reveal to me the hope you hold for this nation’s greatness. As long as we walk together and work together, we shall arrive at our national greatness together. To this glad and great endeavour, I fully devote myself and my future labour.  
8. In full compliance with existing law and regulation, I submitted all necessary documents regarding my nomination as the APC presidential candidate to INEC. But, as was expected, the choice of my vice presidential running mate remained an open and burning question. 
9. This gave rise to much speculation and debate. 
10. Recent events [the voluntary withdrawal of my dear friend and brother Ibrahim Masari] mean that I am called upon, today, to put an end to the speculation. 
11. I have never been an indecisive man and have no present intention to become one.  
12. What I am, however, is a democrat. And a democrat must listen to, and consult with, the people and his advisors so that he may reform and govern wisely and on their behalf. This I have done. My political career was not built on blind indifference to the views of others. I appreciate the perspectives of leading members of the party, political allies and key national figures who see Nigeria’s future as I do. They gave me their views so that I might add their valuable insights to mine to reach the best decision possible and do so in a manner that strengthens the institutional fabric of our party as well as accelerating the evolution of our political democracy.
13. I am also a founding member of the APC. I hold our party’s core principles close to heart such that I shall do nothing to betray the spirit in which the party was created. 
14. Having now listened to the sage, careful advice of a broad section of the party and of the nation, there are a few points I feel I must make about the exceptional and extraordinary person with whom I will share the APC ticket and the principles of open and good governance  that informed this choice.
15. A dominant theme of my political history and my personal life is my staunch belief in our diversity. Greatness lies in embracing our diversity and making it work to enhance the dynamism and justice of our political system. My selection of a running mate comports entirely with this longstanding inclination.  
16. The concurrence of my party in this matter has been a source of comfort and encouragement. We are truly building a progressive party that not only represents a departure from other political parties but one that truly may well be the best hope for democratic good governance in Nigeria. 
17. I realize the momentous times we have entered. I know what lies in the balance. I also know that our political choices and activities send both intended and unintended signals to portions of the Nigerian electorate.  
18. All my life, my decisions regarding the team around and supporting me have always been guided by the principles of competence, innovation, compassion, integrity, fairness, and adherence to excellence. 
19. When I was Governor of Lagos State, these principles helped me assemble one of the most capable governing cabinets any state or this nation has ever seen. I trust enough in these principles to allow them to, once more, guide me to construct another exemplary team that can do Nigeria proud. 
20. Second, this chapter in our country’s history demands a bold yet pragmatic approach, a path already chartered by the progressive ethos of the APC. The foundation for sustainable progress has been laid these past seven years by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. The challenges of today are consequential because the lives and livelihoods of millions of Nigerians lie in the balance. Visionary and creative leadership will take us to our goal. 
21. Our focus, therefore, must be on getting the job done; and that means getting the very best and competent people to do it. In this crucial moment, where so much is at stake, we must prioritize leadership, competence, and the ability to work as a team over other considerations. 
22. I am mindful of the energetic discourse concerning the possible religion of my running mate. Just and noble people have talked to me about this. Some have counselled that I should select a Christian to please the Christian community. Other have said I should pick a Muslim to appeal to the Muslim community. Clearly, I cannot do both. 
23. Both sides of the debate have impressive reason and passionate arguments supporting their position. Both arguments are right in their own way. But neither is right in the way that Nigeria needs at the moment. As president, I hope to govern this nation toward uncommon progress. This will require innovation. It will require steps never before taken. It will also require decisions that are politically difficult and rare. 
24. If I am to be that type of President, I must begin by being that type of candidate. Let me make the bold and innovative decision not to win political points but to move the nation and our party’s campaign closer to the greatness that we were meant to achieve.  
25. Here is where politics ends, and true leadership must begin. 
26. Today, I announce my selection with pride because I have made it not based on religion or to please one community or the other. I made this choice because I believe this is the man who can help me bring the  best governance to all Nigerians, period, regardless of their religious affiliation or considerations of ethnicity or region.
27. May I say this to all of you, especially to those who will be disappointed in my selection based on religious considerations. I will not and cannot ignore the religious concerns and ethnic sensitivities of our people. Taking them into due consideration is an important part of good and able governance. But religion, ethnicity and region cannot always and fully determine our path. To forge ahead as a nation toward development and prosperity, we must break free of old binds. We must recalibrate our political calculations to where competence and fairness matter more than reductive demographics. 
28. This is why, today, I announce the selection of SENATOR KASHIM SHETTIMA as my partner and running mate in the mission to advance and reclaim the fortunes of this great country and the hopes of its people.
29. Senator Kasim Shettima’s career in politics and beyond shows that he is eminently qualified not only to deliver that all important electoral victory, but, also, step into the shoes of the Vice President. As a man with the talent, maturity, strength of character, and patriotism he has my implicit confidence and faith.
30. I am aware that many will continue focus on a particular detail, the question of his faith. 
31. However, if we truly understand the challenges upon us a nation, then we must also see the imperative of placing  competence in governance above religious sentiment. 
32. In 1993, Nigerians embrace Chief MKO Abiola and a fellow Muslim running mate, Baba Gana Kingibe in one of our fairest elections ever held. 
33. The spirit of 1993 is upon us again in 2023. 
34. As such, the ticket we present today represents a milestone in our political history. It symbolizes our party’s determination to be a leading light among political parties in Africa. 
35. The democratic process and the decorum that characterised our presidential primaries and the selection of our vice presidential candidate exemplifies why we are the party of the people and of the betterment of their future.  With this selection the All Progressives Congress surely shall continue to be the party that shows the way and carries this nation towards its best future. I implore you all to join with me on this journey to a brighter future.

Signed.

7/11/22, 7:27 AM - +234 814 235 8262: With Kashim Shettima as the running-mate for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the votes of Borno and Yobe are in the ballot box of APC, Taraba and Bauchi will be for APC while Gombe and Adamawa will go to PDP, this is the electoral permutation of the #Northeast.

For the #Southwest, it is a surety that Tinubu will be ahead in all the six Oduduwa states, the #Southsouth will be divided between the two party, the #Southeast will surely vote for one of their own, Peter Obi; the #NorthCentral will vote along religious line, the Muslim states will APC and Benue and Plateau will vote for PDP.

The #Northwest, which is the vote bank of the country, will vote according to the political interest of the states' stakeholders, Kano and possibly Jigawa will vote for Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, Kaduna and Katsina will vote APC while Zamfara and Kebbi too will vote APC, Sokoto will go for PDP. The overall result will be a victory for APC.

Let there be a national rise of voices and watch to see what government does. No matter how cruel a government is, there will still be a portion of fear when they see the entire nation showing concern on a particular topic. They will put in their best to fast-track whatever decision to suppress the outcry.

This is one of the prices the public needs to pay if we are so serious about putting an end to this lingering strike!

7/11/22, 9:59 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): INTERNAL MEMO
11/7/22

To: All Concerned, Media Team of Obi-Datti Campaign, 2023 

Please as directed by the Leadership of the Obi-Datti Campaign, we wish to inform our Media team and Spokespersons  in the Labour Party to avoid and stear clear of discussions on APC's Muslim/Muslim ticket as we have been advised to resist being dragged into the debate by the Press.

Our responses, if neccessary, should be "though we are mindful of the activities of our political opponents, we do not concern ourselves with thier internal political parties issues and so we are essentially focused on our mantra of taking back Nigeria and changing the country from consumption to production" 

To this end, our attention and promotion should be purely focused on our Candidates and what we are bringing to Nigerians which is  unity and prosperity for all.

Thanks.

Dr Yunusa Tanko 
Chief Spokesperson,
Obi-Datti Campaign, 2023

7/12/22, 2:05 PM - +234 706 342 5524: Cos of the health dangers of being very ill and still working, I made an opening for social media marketers yesterday.

It made me to come to the conclusion that,

Copywriters are the number one problem of youths in this generation 🤦🤦

In their desperation to make sales, they're deceiving youths with lies and false statements that they call 'copies'

I just came across one that said 'How to publish on Amazon even if you do not know how to write'.

I really do not understand. And you'll still people, youths particularly, rushing to attend the class because they're looking for shortcut.

Then when it does not work out, they come to Facebook and say online webinars are scam. No, dear. They aren't scam. You're just the one looking for fast routes to success.

How can you even sit down and decide to publish content on Amazon with plagiarized or poorly written words? Isn't that folly.

But this is the disposition of many of us towards success. 

You just started learning a skill two months ago, you're already pitching for clients. That's like an undergraduate of Medicine calling himself a medical doctor.

If you continue this way, you will keep jumping from pillar to post and you will become frustrated.

Calm down. Don't be in a haste to make money. Be futuristic in your thinking. Even if you manage to make some money presently, is that what will sustain you for Life?

This issue really got me angry yesterday.

I got a pitch from a guy who claims to be a social media marketer. He said he wanted to assist me with the brands I'm working for.

His packaging was lit. His diction was clean. His pitch was superb. But his brain was empty. 

He thought he was pitching to a consumer that purchases things by emotions. That's what most copywriters are taught to do.

I asked him, 

Have you heard of HubSpot? He said no.
Hootsuite? Nope.
Sproutsocial? Nope.
Birdsend? Nope.
Coscheduler? Nope.
Clickfunnels? Nope.

I was like 🙄🙄

What now makes you a social media marketer when the very tools we use for marketing are alien to you? He started with his annoying pitch again.

I asked him about terms like Social proof, social listening and campaign metrics, oga could not answer.

I was so pissed off that I blocked him.

If that guy doesn't get any job as a Social Media Marketer, I bet you he'll quit it and enter blogging or any other 'get-rich' scheme.

Don't be like that bros. Settle down and learn what you're learning well. 

I devote at least three hours of my day to developing my skill. Multiply 3 hours by 7 days in a week. That's 21 hours. In a month, that's 84 hours.

If you can give 84 hours to any skill at all every month, there's nothing on earth that can stop you from becoming a master in it.

BAT is settling for Shettima a muslim Muslim ticket.

It was wrong to have same religion ticket in 015 all of sudden 2023 it’s not wrong to have same religion ticket .

Tradition won't allow such if it were to be from the CIA
7/12/22, 9:48 PM - +234 810 619 9957: I belive that scenario is quite different  from 2015 & 2023 agenda. In 2015 same ticket was a bad idea now it’s a good idea that’s my own point and I need someone to explain wat am not seeing.
7/12/22, 9:51 PM - +234 816 463 6464: No one will explain nada to you 🤣

7/12/22, 9:56 PM - +234 813 288 6674: My view is, Buhari felt he's from North and selling himself in the south is the issue. So he couldn't use a Muslim VP, as that won't be sellable.
Tinubu is from South and he feels he needs to sell himself in the North, he feels Muslim VP will be very easy to sell to an average "core Northerner" compared to a Christian
7/12/22, 9:57 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Thanks for that illustration 👍

7/13/22, 11:59 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): David Hundeyin 🐐 

Finished the drug baron with no identity in his early years in just 1 article. Anyone with sane mind obviously know voting Tinubu is putting the future of this country in great jeopardy (of course, your coming generations are part of that future). 

Make generations to come still dey find how to japa in 15/20 years? No. I won’t commit such disservice. I have just one vote but by extension and influence, I have hundreds. I’ll use my vote and influence well. ✌️
7/13/22, 12:54 PM - +234 817 014 8364: Happy Birthday leader.

Today, you are all celebrating a news that’s not true. Celebrating the decamping of same inconsequential man. 

I wonder if those of you who do politics in Lagos and most especially those of you in APC reason at all

7/13/22, 6:00 PM - +234 706 452 6359: *AWALOKAN 2023:*

I'm fully back in APC to join our Southwest leaders as well as progressive Family and friends in Lagos State. 

The awalokan 2023 is a project that both young and old  in all the nooks and crannies of the Southwest should be embraced.

On this note, I sincerely join APC from the major opposition party *(PDP)* to add my strength...

I believe It's time to support and also to appreciate *Senator* *Asiwaju Bola Ahmed TINUBU* as next President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the forthcoming Presidential election on the platform of the *All Progressives* *Congress (APC).* 

- *JIMI AGBAJE.*

No rich person I’ve ever seen in politics that’s clean, so using his pasts to hunt TINUBU is a no point deal.

7/14/22, 9:00 AM - +234 810 640 0477: What is Ogun State turning into  oooooooooo?😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

 Hmmmmmmmm wonders shall never end
Oh God!!!!!! I can't believe this, so much tears in my eyes. Ogun state needs prayer! This is a girl called Dorcas  SS2 student she left her house and was going for a Youth Program at her Church at about 3pm. She took a Taxi and the Taxi man, whose name we later got as Alabi

On their way to the church the Taxi man took a different road, Dorcas asked why?
He said he was running away from the police men at a check point ahead.

She started feeling uncomfortable but kept quiet and was just praying, knowing the world we are living in is filled with evil.
The man continued and took a different turn again, at this point, she begged him to drop her, instead he(driver) increased the speed.

The man headed for a nearby bush, dropped her, pretended he was urinating and then dropped a 1000naira note.

He then told Dorcas she dropped her money, she said no, it wasn't her. But he insisted and started forcing her to pick the money. Dorcas cried out! Luckily, a man who was in the nearby bush heard, hurried to the scene, seeing the manner at which he was rough handling the lady, waded in and beat up the man and insisted that he picks his money back but the man refused, still claiming the money belongs to Dorcas.
As God would have it, 10 other hefty men who were traveling on the same road, observed the scene and parked their bus. They all alighted from the bus and asked questions, hearing what transpired between them(Dorcas and the driver), they asked and forced the taxi driver to pick the money.

Immediately the man picked the money, you can't imagine what happened...

He turn to PVC...

Shebi una like story?

GO and GET ur PVC...U must Vote a Credible leader 2023.... 

Una well-done oo...how Una dey?

Reminds of when Ajimobi didn’t allow Seyi Makinde talk on a radio program in Ogbomosho few days to election in 2019. Ajimobi also denied Seyi Makinde access to campaign in LAUTECH. And on Election Day? 
We all saw how Seyi Makinde massacred APC. Imole ma taan l’Osun. It’s about time 💡
7/14/22, 2:34 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): From all indications, PDP has won Saturday’s election in Osun. What the party should focus on now is how to block, resist and repel any attempt by APC to rig or intimidate voters.

Strategic plans should be in place for that. And it should be FIRE FOR FIRE as declared by Davido. Give it to them pound by pound! 🤌
When they eventually result to violence and rigging like they did in 2018, there should be solid plans in place to make them realize no one has the monopoly of it. 

All *big boys* in Oyo state should have been transported to Osun by now. ✌️

Majority lack content.
7/14/22, 10:29 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Lasun was Former deputy speaker and he is a grassroots mobilizer o 

Even if na that 1 LG he go win.

7/14/22, 10:34 PM - +234 703 446 8168: @2348163162679 

The last election in Osun was a close one cos PDP did well in Ijesha land, EDE and flopped In Oshogbo.

This time around, they will do well in EDE as usual and Ijesha land but APC is crazier in the less cities and Religious factor is a big effect in Osun state.

Those small cities Ehn 😌
7/14/22, 10:34 PM - Safe journey: Oga e Kia naa😂😂

7/14/22, 10:37 PM - +234 703 446 8168: His win in his LG is a win for the PDP 💯 

I know him to be vibrant but winning a LG on the LP ticket is the issue…

That LG is dominantly APC where they see LP as opposition to BAT

Loosing the capital (states election) is loosing the election

As of then, I know what happened and my analysis conforms with what’s going on in osun
7/14/22, 10:52 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Make dem just collapse structure

However, the AREGBE factor is key!
7/14/22, 10:53 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Aregbe too! 

His silence means a lot 

Plus his candidate lost court case yesterday
7/14/22, 10:53 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Ask people who are not from EDE or IRAGBIJI…

7/14/22, 10:53 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I’ve answered you already and moved on sir 

Adeleke owns Osun.
7/14/22, 10:54 PM - +234 703 446 8168: if he acts anyhow…he will f up!

He will eventually be quiet and no field work…he will still vote Oyetola

But make he sha dey silent like that.
7/14/22, 10:55 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Stop reading things online…

And in reality, 5000 persons that were there for APC still went for PDP…


Naso crowd deh be!
7/14/22, 10:57 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): When I want to read the true state of things about election, I avoid pages of people who are partisan.

That’s the only place you go really get to know the truth.
7/14/22, 10:57 PM - +234 818 709 0967: All I can say is that APC is sweeping the whole of Southwest state come 2023.

7/14/22, 11:02 PM - +234 703 446 8168: @2349037490597 

Check LOCAL GOVT by LOCAL GOVT…

Check previous results and major stakeholders with how they hold their strongholds!

That way, you know the stronger party!

In 2018, ADELEKE was the STRONGER CANDIDATE but APC was the STRONGER PARTY - the same thing at the moment
7/14/22, 11:02 PM - +234 818 709 0967: I'm so confident about it.... None of the southwest states will be lost.

Now you get this now…

I served in Osun (Oriade LG) and ERIN OKE to be precise…

A good number of CORPS MEMBERS went to watch Davido, are they the voters that matter? NO!

That’s what I’m saying

I am voting SEYI , he’s my employer but I’m not voting his party in the election a week before his
7/14/22, 11:07 PM - Safe journey: Even if they said so, not like you got it from another party naa

So, nothing change

But you sound like SEYI will lose to APC in 2023

Una Sha so believe in this rigging sha😂😂😂

Next Year is here
7/14/22, 11:08 PM - +234 703 446 8168: I no really hear clearly cos of AFRICA magic family here 😂
7/14/22, 11:09 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Don’t underestimate that ALLIANCE…


If SEYI wins with that alliance coming together…he’s another BIG THING in Nigeria politics.


‘alliance’ - read about the alliance that made him the governor
7/14/22, 11:09 PM - +234 818 709 0967: Lol.... Who mentioned rigging here?

All I can say is that Asiwaju aren't losing any southwestern states.
7/14/22, 11:10 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Anything contrary to this is delusional
7/14/22, 11:10 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): You care to tell us how it will happen? 

Since rigging is out of it 

*Asiwaju* is not losing
7/14/22, 11:10 PM - +234 818 709 0967: Till then.....
7/14/22, 11:11 PM - +234 818 709 0967: Really?

Alright.
7/14/22, 11:11 PM - Safe journey: You don't mention Asiwaju before


You said no Southwest state will be left out..
7/14/22, 11:11 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): This is why I no reply you before sir 😂

You didn’t disappoint me
7/14/22, 11:11 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Bro, the only difficult state to win for Asiwaju will be Ondo state…

He will win the SW 85/90% - not by margin but by states won
7/14/22, 11:11 PM - +234 818 709 0967: Read the statement again..... For the incoming Southwestern president I said
7/14/22, 11:12 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Gubernatorial is what he is saying not presidential
7/14/22, 11:12 PM - +234 703 446 8168: I meant anything contrary to him winning is delusional
7/14/22, 11:12 PM - +234 818 709 0967: Read this please 👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻
7/14/22, 11:12 PM - +234 703 446 8168: He said ASIWAJU…he’s on the ballot and not as a leader na
7/14/22, 11:12 PM - +234 818 709 0967: I said *Its a bold statement for the incoming president of the southwest*
7/14/22, 11:13 PM - +234 814 235 8262: Why Ondo?
7/14/22, 11:13 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Aghhhhh


Oga….OYO state 😂
7/14/22, 11:14 PM - +234 818 709 0967: What happen to it?
7/14/22, 11:14 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Ondo is more of Christians and they were not progressives from time immemorial…


Just the FASHOLA effect swept that place in favour of the progressives 

It will be close but APC might still win that presidency
7/14/22, 11:14 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Banking on alliance…APC stands a chance but if otherwis….


SEYI MAKINDE ni oooo
7/14/22, 11:15 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I have typed your reply many times but deleted it. 

The last time, I copied it before deleting. If you press further, all I need to do is paste
7/14/22, 11:15 PM - +234 703 446 8168: 😂
7/14/22, 11:15 PM - +234 814 235 8262: 😂
Why did you feel attacked 😂
7/14/22, 11:16 PM - +234 818 709 0967: Let me make my statement more clearer....

*_All Guber elections in Southwest will be won by APC for the incoming president of the soil_*
7/14/22, 11:16 PM - Safe journey: Kosi wahala.....

Remember alot can still change before next year

Example....Nobody predicted Obi movement until now


So anything can still happen In Politics before next year

ATIKU or TINUBU fit die before next Year
7/14/22, 11:16 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Next time, you’ll tag me with your full chest 

But since you can’t, I helped you out. You’ve been craving for my attention and I have to give you a little dose of it so you can have a good night rest
7/14/22, 11:16 PM - +234 814 235 8262: 😂
7/14/22, 11:16 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): So @2347034468168 do you understand better now?
7/14/22, 11:17 PM - +234 818 709 0967: Know this today.... 24hrs is too long for things not to happen in politics.

The Seyi coalition happens in less than 48hrs to election.

Wait for the swing coming....
7/14/22, 11:17 PM - +234 818 709 0967: I can't dispute Gods factor...

7/14/22, 11:17 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): There is no swing 😂 

No swing will bring alliance from the aggrieved in PDP and APC together.
7/14/22, 11:18 PM - +234 818 709 0967: You missed it.
7/14/22, 11:18 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Okay sir
7/14/22, 11:19 PM - Safe journey: Kosi wahala sir...
7/14/22, 11:19 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Personal?
😂 

It’s just surprising it’s you that want to drag Funke Akindele for her interview. You? 🤣
7/14/22, 11:20 PM - +234 818 709 0967: Let me give you a hint... The major centre point here will be ASIWAJU himself.

This is not APC/PDP swing you are thinking, ok.
7/14/22, 11:20 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Social media is a leveler
7/14/22, 11:21 PM - Safe journey: @2347034468168 abi bawo lese ri si
7/14/22, 11:21 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Seems it’s clustered and difficult to comprehend now

It will get clearer as we approach 2023. 

God no go kill anyone

Alas, not over ruling his return base on some circumstances.

Like I said.... 24hrs is damm too far in politics.

7/14/22, 11:27 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I didn’t even hear of the rumour at all. For real 

Maybe cos I was in camp and not really active
7/14/22, 11:27 PM - +234 818 709 0967: Not of recent o

7/14/22, 11:45 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Adeoti is from Iwo. He is the strongest politician here.
7/14/22, 11:46 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): APC would win Iwo.
7/14/22, 11:47 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Yes…He was an APC decamped then!

He won Iwo that year!

If he is in APC this time around, APC is winning Iwo 💯
7/14/22, 11:48 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): He is the one Aregbe is supporting
7/14/22, 11:48 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Na wetin cause Aregbe and Oyetol Wahala gangan be that 

He is aggrieved
7/14/22, 11:48 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Yeah…AREGBE wanted him the last time too
7/14/22, 11:48 PM - +234 703 446 8168: But bowed to party supremacy
7/14/22, 11:48 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Adeoti, he as congested for APC primary twice. He's backed up by Aregbesola. It's because of Adeoti that fight happened between Aregbesola and Tinubu.
7/14/22, 11:48 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Aregbesola supported Adeoti to succeed him at last election, Tinubu wanted Oyetola
7/14/22, 11:48 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Yes, he isn't. Their court case was decided today. Aregbe and Adeoti tookl Oyetola to court. They want disqualification of Oyetola from APC primary, on the ground that constitution of APC negates a sitting governor and who is intending to contest for primary to be in a caretaker committee of the party.
7/14/22, 11:48 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Their case was rulled out today in Abuja.
7/14/22, 11:49 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Aregbesola faction isn't with Oyetola at all. That one is very evident. In the list of APC's delegates for Osun election, it's only Aregbesola that isn't on the list.
7/14/22, 11:50 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Yes. Since they are divided. That's what PDP are leveraging on here in Iwo.
7/14/22, 11:50 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Though, all these civi servants and retirees, confirmed PDP ni gbogbo won.
7/14/22, 11:50 PM - +234 703 446 8168: The problem is : will AREGBE declare support for PDP or not
7/14/22, 11:51 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Na neutral people me I dey ask for update

They will  give you situation report unbiased 

APC will win Iwo but PDP will have votes there. More votes than they should have if Adeoti wasn’t aggrieved
7/14/22, 11:51 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): He can’t
7/14/22, 11:51 PM - +234 703 446 8168: 💯
7/14/22, 11:51 PM - +234 703 446 8168: That would be anti party
7/14/22, 11:52 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Le emi na abi 🤣
7/14/22, 11:52 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): From all indications, it will be a bloody election
7/14/22, 11:53 PM - +234 703 446 8168: ADEOTI won Iwo last time out from ADP ooo


APC & PDP votes no even reach him own 😂 


He’s the strongest politician in Iwo
7/14/22, 11:53 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Bumper to Bumper election
7/14/22, 11:55 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Adeoti should just declare support for PDP
7/14/22, 11:56 PM - +234 703 446 8168: 😂

7/15/22, 7:26 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Obviously, what she displayed yesterday wasn’t her best. She should stay away from media engagem till she has fully absolved herself into the system
7/15/22, 7:26 AM - +234 810 619 9957: @2347034468168  we cant know it all at least she stylishly admitted that. She and her jandor full 3rd mainland like kilode but to my greatest Sanwolu is not campaigning in Lagos is that how sure is victory his?
7/15/22, 7:26 AM - +234 810 619 9957: Good point👍
7/15/22, 7:27 AM - +234 810 619 9957: Greatest surprise *
7/15/22, 7:28 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Normally, the ruling Governor seeking re-election doesn’t have much campaign to do yet. 
Campaigns have not even started. According to INEC’s guidelines. 

DA has not started campaign in Ogun 
Seyi has not started in Oyo
7/15/22, 7:28 AM - +234 810 619 9957: 🤔 fair enough….
7/15/22, 8:01 AM - +234 808 351 8616: We go pretend as if we don't know Aregbe and Oyetola get issues, when you dey talk say he wasn't present...

But it's fine to dream

In Nigeria, it's also fine to believe in the ability of your party to rig
7/15/22, 8:33 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Na the best rigger dey win
7/15/22, 8:34 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I asked Oga how they want to do it, he no give me any explanation 😂

What they sha know is they will win it
7/15/22, 8:35 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Your own party no dey rig???😏
7/15/22, 8:36 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Which party no dey rig?
7/15/22, 8:36 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): If you ask me how my party intend to win election, I’ll at least be able to tell you you something 

I won’t tell you there is no plan but wait till 2023

7/15/22, 8:45 AM - +234 816 463 6464: And they want to exonerate the misyarn of the Agbado Master.....
7/15/22, 8:53 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): The irony of it 😂

People supporting an incoherent drug dealer who rambles when speaking and with questionable background are calling for Funke Akindele’s head - Funke that’s answering questions on politics for the first time in her almost 5 decades. 


I wonder if these people think deep at all. 

There are times I want to cook something but I’ll have to restrict myself cos I know if we search deep, even my candidate is guilty. But my brothers from the other side, ba sense
7/15/22, 8:59 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Please, who is or was in Enactus here?

God!

Even if it's sure for you that Obi can not win and your Candidate will win, talk like someone who has small sense, even if you don't have sense and you know you don't, try to talking like someone who has the fear of God or the love of humanity

But by all indications, seems she fucked up
7/15/22, 9:19 AM - +234 810 815 2940: She no prepare before granting interview?
7/15/22, 9:20 AM - +234 816 463 6464: Anybody can be part of the team.... I think they carry out assessment test (I can't remember) and interview during recruitment....

It's basically for anybody that is interested in Entrepreneurship and Human Capital Development
7/15/22, 9:21 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): She did not fuck up beyond fuck up 😂 But agenda must agend 

The only questions she was unable to answer well were practical questions about Lagos infrastructure and the likes. 
And I think that’s because she does not really know whr the shoe pinches. She messed up totally there

How many interviews did Desmond granted when contesting and how was his first interview (if he ever had one while contesting)

How was 9ice first interview when contesting under the APC platform?

It's just annoying when I see supposedly educated people behave in an irrational manner 🤦🏻‍♂️

Dude is playing hard ball and intellectual politricks 😂 

Seyi will not take in the required number of corps members…

THE SCENARIO
Oyo state needs 1500 corps members for effectiveness and they will be 5k each

THE POLITRICKS OF GSM
The state has been mandated to take in 1/3 of that which is 500 corps members and pay them 15k each 

THE RESULT
The media shows the government of Oyo state is paying 15k to corps members which is good for publicity and positive PR

But in reality, the effectiveness of the job is telling on the civil servants as we have to overwork ourselves to make up for the 1000 corps members rejected by the state


This is GSM ALAGBARI 😂
7/15/22, 11:19 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Omo
Corpers being posted to government parastatals no reach 700 🤣🤣

 Hmmmmmmmm wonders shall never end
Oh God!!!!!! I can't believe this, so much tears in my eyes. Ogun state needs prayer! This is a girl called Dorcas  SS2 student she left her house and was going for a Youth Program at her Church at about 3pm. She took a Taxi and the Taxi man, whose name we later got as Alabi

On their way to the church the Taxi man took a different road, Dorcas asked why?
He said he was running away from the police men at a check point ahead.

She started feeling uncomfortable but kept quiet and was just praying, knowing the world we are living in is filled with evil.
The man continued and took a different turn again, at this point, she begged him to drop her, instead he(driver) increased the speed.

The man headed for a nearby bush, dropped her, pretended he was urinating and then dropped a 1000naira note.

He then told Dorcas she dropped her money, she said no, it wasn't her. But he insisted and started forcing her to pick the money. Dorcas cried out! Luckily, a man who was in the nearby bush heard, hurried to the scene, seeing the manner at which he was rough handling the lady, waded in and beat up the man and insisted that he picks his money back but the man refused, still claiming the money belongs to Dorcas.
As God would have it, 10 other hefty men who were traveling on the same road, observed the scene and parked their bus. They all alighted from the bus and asked questions, hearing what transpired between them(Dorcas and the driver), they asked and forced the taxi driver to pick the money.

Immediately the man picked the money, you can't imagine what happened...

He turn to PVC...

Shebi una like story?

7/15/22, 8:40 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Why I was arrested during Osun 2018 rerun election

 
I covered the Osun 2018 rerun election in PU 1, Orolu LGA in Kajola. Police officers, soldiers and APC thugs unleashed terror in that polling unit. I was arrested but far terrible things happened.

Time was around 7.40a.m. I’d just arrived at the polling unit wearing full INEC accreditation. The commission had declared the Osun election inconclusive and the fate of the state lay in the decision of voters in 7 polling units in 4 LGAs.

Flashback to about 10 minutes, individuals who identified themselves as APC agents welcomed me and five other observers and promised to ‘take care’ of us. Few minutes later they handed N300k to one of us (an observer of a highly revered election group) to share N50k each. I rejected my ‘share’ and that was the beginning of my problem.

The moment I decided to snap some pictures of the polling unit, some fierce-looking police officers rushed me, grabbed me by my trousers and dragged me to the stationed black maria. One of them, Abdul Usman, confiscated all my properties after ordering me to 'delete the pictures.'

Thereafter, their leader, with the name tag, S Abubakar, came to question me. “You are a journalist you are supposed to know. No camera is allowed here,” he said. I protested, told him it was against INEC’s directive and that I was only doing my job. All to deaf ears. I was later released. Now, this is where it got scary.

To enter the polling unit, you needed to pass at least 15 checkpoints (no exaggeration) manned by police officers and soldiers. Only electorates, with the intention of voting for APC were allowed into the polling unit. Their voter’s cards had been collected earlier, so they needed to meet some APC agents to retrieve it, vote and get their palms greased (20k).

I witnessed one PDP supporter plead for his life, bloodied. He was beaten by security officials for insisting on accessing the polling unit. One was entirely stripped naked in humiliation.  A few others ended up in the black maria like me, many were turned back. Final results in the polling unit, APC: 111, PDP: 3. How those 3 were able to vote still amazes me. I'd love to speak with them if they can be identified.

Now back to my experience. For hours, I couldn’t do anything other than watch while being watched. No mobile network to communicate with my office. I’d already decided to leave the polling unit when I spotted two of my journalist colleagues Taiwo Adebulu and Ibrahim Adeyemi .Some relief!

By noon, most of the expected voters had cast their votes. Emphasis on 'expected'. Gunshots, which had somehow become normal, were heard repeatedly, so we decided to leave the polling unit. Some security officers and thugs were also leaving at the time. 
I saw thugs wield guns, machetes and charms, smoke hemp and threatened people but police officers looked away. One senior officer told a thug to ‘keep that thing very well’ when he (the thug) flaunted a locally made gun. That was shortly before another traumatic incident.

Halfway through the muddy path that leads to the closest road, my friend Taiwo made the terrible mistake of bringing out his phone to snap. All hell was let loose! He was rushed immediately. This time by thugs. That moment and the minutes that followed were scary. One of them threatened to machete Taiwo, another threatened charm. They asked us to leave and forget about the phone and they meant it.

I led the ‘beggy beggy’ team. That boy should be in his early twenties but I called him egbon. In fact, we called all of them egbon. ‘Egbon ejo ema binu. A ma delete e’ we kept saying. At this stage, leaving alive and uninjured was the priority. The phone was later released and we escaped the dungeon.

Some of us are alive to tell the story today, some others, including a pregnant woman in Ife, were killed. As we go to polls again tomorrow, I wish the people of my dear state the very best. May the best candidate win.

NOTE: I was asked to write about this event in 2018 but was too traumatised. Ibrahim Adeyemi has a more detailed account here: https://saharareporters.com/2018/10/12/reporters-diary-rerun-moments-osun-state-governorship-riggers

7/15/22, 10:08 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Osun Governorship Election tomorrow: Looking back at 2018 Results.
---------
As our people are about to vote again - tomorrow, I feel certain things will likely remain the same.

1. Whoever voted for APC 4yrs ago will likely still vote APC again and whoever voted for PDP then will still likely do same this year.. If there will be new transitions or changes, they are going to be limited.

2. Omisore SDP was a big third force four years ago as pulled 127, 949 with his biggest votes coming from the 4 local governments of Ife and 2 local governments of Osogbo. In Osogbo, he almost got similar vote with PDP. Check Olorunda and Osogbo LG and compare. 

In short whoever gets bulk of his old voters in Ife and Osogbo will likely win the election. Ife is flashpoint. PDP and APC are already claiming they will surprise themselves. We shall see. 

Osogbo is becoming a heated centre in the last few weeks, the result from there which is usually the biggest shows greenlight of winner, so everyone will want to ensure their voters in Osogbo can largely vote. It was also APC biggest vote bloc last time.

ADP votes last time reflects Aregbe supporters, 49,744 is something too. The Top faction have said they remain in APC even though they didn't express their wish to wholeheartedly vote for Oyetola.

3. The likelihood of people coming out to vote is a factor. I hope people can show courage to vote.

4. The election might be monetized and militarised. It doesn't appear to come easy.  

5. The winner after kangaroo strategic Rerun was declared with barely 400 votes, probably one of the smallest winning votes in any Governorship election in anywhere in Nigeria.

Now, study the last election results again.

See you all tomorrow or next tomorrow. I pray for an hitch free voting exercise.

Nigeria’s election will forever be monetised 😢
7/16/22, 2:22 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Per voter oooo!


How much per PU???
7/16/22, 2:24 PM - +234 810 619 9957: How do we now want to get it right?
7/16/22, 2:25 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Join APC/PDP/LP as a member, begin the orirentation and re-orientation…


By the time it’s our turn, monetisation will be drastically reduced cos it’s all dependent on the kind/type of members a party have
7/16/22, 2:26 PM - +234 816 463 6464: I am glad to see you add LP 😊....

The PO effect
7/16/22, 2:27 PM - +234 810 619 9957: I will think abt it
7/16/22, 2:34 PM - +234 703 446 8168: That’s cos you love to make noise on social media…

We can hear you rant online but your party is not sensible enough to have a candidate of their own in Ekiti and Osun.

They waited for dying minute decampee in Osun and their candidate in Ekiti supported APC.

You never ready

7/16/22, 2:42 PM - +234 810 815 2940: You said they didn't field a candidate

That's why I'm asking if Lasun is contesting under APC2 party and not LP
7/16/22, 2:43 PM - +234 703 446 8168: The elections of OSUN & EKITI is supposed to be a statement from LP!

They waited until someone came from another party!

They didn’t have their own candidate from get go…

In reality, it was LASUN who fielded LP not LP fielding a candidate. The same thing in Ekiti state

• With the close fight APC is giving in Osun guber…

• …isn’t it evident APC will win presidency in Osun state if you separate LP from PDP during presidential election ?

Did you see this?

People are tired of APC

90% of those that voted APC in 2019 will vote them again…while 30% of PDP (ATIKU) voters will vote Obi and 50/60% of new registered voters will cast Obi’: ballot too.

BAT will reciprocate a little less than / greater than or equal to the number BUHARI polled in 2019

7/16/22, 11:44 PM - +234 703 446 8168: NW historically vote on BABA SOPE - their key stakeholders will determine the vote swings regardless of the regions candidates are coming from

With Shettima on the APC ticket…the APC will loose North East but not with a wide margin as expected.

Don’t forget some states in the NE&NW are historically CPC. They always deliver even when they had no governors like now in the North. The Muslim Muslim ticket is a big factor too.

The North Central will vote on religion
The  Christian dominated region will vote PDP/LP

The Muslim dominated states will vote APC/PDP

SW will vote in bloc for APC with close margin

SE will vote LP with wide margin

SS will be shared btw PDP&LP but APC stands a good chance in some states there … coming close second


As of today, I don’t see APC loosing the election. Anything can happen tomorrow.
7/16/22, 11:45 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Let’s focus on Osun first abeg

7/17/22, 10:16 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): ALAO AKALA LOCKS OUT SEYI MAKINDE FROM HIS FM RADIO STATION

Ripples from the last moments leading to the gubernatorial election on Saturday, March 9 2019 reached a crescendo as former governor of Oyo State, Chief Christopher Adebayo Alao Akala openly barred the PDP governorship candidate, Engr Seyi Makinde from participating in a live interview programme on Parrot FM 101.1 owned by Akala in Ogbomoso this morning.

A statement from Seyi Makinde campaign organization, signed by Prince Dotun Oyelade revealed that Makinde had booked and paid for the one hour slot at the radio station 48 hours in advance, and came to Ogbomoso for the programme only to be turned back at the gate with the excuse that the slot had been allocated to his rival, Mr Bayo Adelabu.

Seyi Makinde told journalists and his teeming supporters that apart from Akala’s action being unconstitutional, it was democratically repugnant for any one, to deny the other the right of reply.

He said Chief Akala did not want him to expose the true reason why he (Akala) joined APC, a move that has dropped his political rating significantly.

He promised to bring the attention of the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission to the ugly incident and to the former governor, he had this to say, 'You can bar me from your radio station, but you cannot debar me from the government house if it is the wish of the Lord and the people.'

As Seyi Makinde left the premises of Parrot FM, a large crowd which had gathered, trooped into the radio station in protest of Akala’s action. Makinde rode slowly in an open roof jeep through the ancient city accompanied by his supporters.

He later went to Ajilete FM 92.1, also in Ogbomoso where he fielded questions in a live interview programme.

7/17/22, 11:26 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I see Osun APC people trying to blame Aregbesola for their woe and I laugh 😂 

The people clearly want Adeleke. Clearly. It would have been a tighter race if Aregbesola was fully with the APC really but he is not the main cause of their problem. Oh, when the issue within their party started and most especially when Oyetola got the party ticket, I thought they all said Aregbesola is not significant? So why are they crying now? 

They have forgotten so soon that Oyetola used a stolen mandate for 4 years and the people have simply reclaimed their mandate. The people of Osun have always wanted and they have always voted for Adeleke. 

The result clearly shows that Power belong to the people. ✌️
7/17/22, 11:26 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I know wetin you dey talk

Akinlade is the joker for Ogun 2023 and no reconciliation can work at this point
7/17/22, 6:24 PM - +234 816 463 6464: It's totally false 😂
7/17/22, 6:25 PM - Safe journey: Is like you don't get it

If APC want to win LADO they don't need to plant Akinlade in PDP

They will surely win before, they hv YAYI, GNI, Gbenga Daniel,  AMOSUN, DAPO himself

So, they don't need to plant anybody, that assumption is very wrong

It was a deliberate move by the Amosun camp
7/17/22, 6:28 PM - Safe journey: That is what am saying, 

For Akinlade to move to PDP, it's a real politics not as @2348098664771 said they plant him in PDP

Do you think Akinlade will go to PDP with AMOSUN support??
7/17/22, 6:28 PM - Safe journey: Correct✅
7/17/22, 6:31 PM - +234 810 619 9957: So u are saying Amosun is not 💯 APC and his bigger than the party’s decision?

7/17/22, 6:32 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Na everyday we dey learn
7/17/22, 6:33 PM - +234 816 463 6464: And the game is this

1. Ogun Central is controlled by Amosun and y'all know where the allegiance will be plus the Égbas no rate Dapo.
2. Ogun West has always been loyal to the APC but with the switch of Triple A, PDP will get a reasonable number of votes from the district.
3. Ogun East votes will be shared as well because both major contenders are son of the soil....

So IMO the deciding factor will be Ogun Central (all things being equal)
7/17/22, 6:33 PM - +234 808 351 8616: Naso i dey learn too oo
7/17/22, 6:33 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Not at all but he found his way back into the hands of APC so is  he going to repeat the same again and still find his way back to APC
7/17/22, 6:33 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Shey party at state level or Federal 😂

7/17/22, 7:09 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Na you dey talk of card carrying member na as if it will matter on election day.....

Part of the reasons I joined the APC in 2014 was the words of my uncle. He told me *"the best for anybody that needs political affiliation to succeed in business is to be a member of both ruling parties"*

So yours truly, not all card carrying member are genuinely members of the party.
7/17/22, 7:10 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Goalpost shifting tactics!

7/17/22, 7:43 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Dude…it was imminent 

And it was building up…it wasn’t just overnight man…PDP had well over a year to fix it but GEJ was adamant…

It all began from Governor’s Forum election where GEJ decided and made it clear that AMAECHI won’t be chairman despite winning.

GEJ’s wife insulting Amaechi in Rivers State…

And lastly, I will tell you again, they didn’t loose interest in PDP’s ideology, they only fell out with the president.


LAgos was ASIWAJU’s since 1999 till date, they will be till at least next 8/12 years.

It isn’t a near future, a far one man

And my reference to 2015 was because that was one major time Lagos APC had issues that almost caused them losing it all....

Those holding the structure are much more than Tinubu forget story. 

Lemme reiterate again that a time will come when aggrieved members of Lagos APC will be there downfall....

7/18/22, 11:19 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): There is perhaps a bigger picture to Osun governor-elect Ademola Adeleke's persona that his traducers and those immersed in this doom-laden clairvoyance aren't putting into consideration: the influence of Deji Adeleke within the Adeleke Dynasty. 

First off, I'd argue that people's fear over Ademola's governance capacity might appear 'pre-emptive', but it is not entirely misplaced, to be sure. Osun's fiscal/debt crisis is quite complicated, and Ademola's freewheeling demeanor doesn't project him as one who will have the PATIENCE, depth, and administrative rigour to wriggle around such mess. He comes across as someone more concerned about merriment, flamboyance, playing Golf at Ada Course, visiting 'Ijesha Falls', and all whatnots.  He would probably scream and wail and, to adopt his own lingo, 'Cry Everyday' (Fi Ojoojumo Sunkun') over the fiscal mess for the first few quarters.

But the bigger consolation is in what many of us aren't seeing: The Adeleke Dynasty. Anyone with even a faint understanding of Osun politics would know that Saturday's mandate wasn't essentially for Jackson, but for the Adeleke Dynasty. And the dynasty wouldn't want to fritter away such massive goodwill. Like I wrote on Femi Owolabi 's, I have tried to speak with people who should know and the resolution is that Ademola, like Isiaka Serubawon before him, is just a face of the dynasty this political season. There are inner forces that may shape the direction of his government. Hopefully. And beyond that enviable spirit of camaraderie we see outside, the family is said to be quite organised within. 

For one, Deji Adeleke has deep network in both government and the private sector and that is what a few analysts I have spoken to are hoping will eventually count. Plus, any discerning observer could see how much Ademola reveres Deji, his major pillar of (financial, moral, social etc) support. Add that to Davido's flamboyance/network and, if exploited so positively, dude MIGHT disappoint his traducers and turn around the condition of the state. 

Or, at the very least, come out less of an administrative disaster, in relative contrast to the doom-laden narratives being widely circulated. Hopefully. Now, this doesn't take away the urgent need for him to be more self-aware, pay attention to optics, and, perhaps, project a 'more gubernatorial' persona.

In this season of widespread anger, social media e-rreverence, doom-doom narratives, and endless condemnations, I have learnt to be more discerning in my appreciation of our developmental challenges. While it is imperative for us to hold government to account, we can as well be realistic in our conception of these problems as well as our appraisal of the possible solutions. We can't all continue to curse the nation to hell, especially because, as in this case of Osun's four year journey, the consequences of our (in)actions revolve around human lives. 

While politicians remain stuck in baseless politicking, those of us concerned ONLY about the development of our nation  must continue to interrogate and spell out positive pathways to redemption/development, notwithstanding the depth of our governance and developmental challenges. 

Osun a dara o.

Jimcruz, considering the part you are taking about, you may be right about your argument but I feel it’s the part most people choose to hold.

There was a part he said, “farmers will make more money, your lunch won’t be imported as we can feed on cassava, agbado, Ewa and lot”

With the other part of that same discussion, that analysis may be right too.
7/19/22, 10:06 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): By feeding our army agbado is how farmer can make more money 😂

Okay.

7/19/22, 10:07 AM - +234 810 206 9268: U sha suppose no say dem go collect the corn for free from the farmers
7/19/22, 10:07 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): It’s the army feeding on agbado that will make the demand rise? 

Oh. Amazing

7/19/22, 10:07 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Did you intentionally ignore the other part not talking about army but the populace at large???

Will it have effect in the long run, YES.

How will it?

The number of rice production mills in Nigeria has increased tremendously and we now produce rice in multiples of tens of thousands than we used to…our improvement has reached “NO STONE IN RICE”
7/19/22, 10:12 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): So how does Tinubu intend to make agbado boom the economy? 

Make us feed on it or how sir?

We can even export this products, No?

How then will it not have effect on the economy???


Jimcruz, you need to think beyond literature and be realistic
7/19/22, 10:16 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Send me where that Tinubu video if you have 

I want to see where he said anything beyond making our army eat agbado 

T for Thanks
7/19/22, 10:18 AM - +234 810 206 9268: Bros no stress me

Go and research on the end products of corn and come back

Secondly I no be Apc member

3rdly I no like soluade for anything

But don’t question people profession like that it’s not good

Some people are on this loop in that dept that look up to him

Criticize with caution 🤦🏿‍♂️
7/19/22, 10:19 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Is it his profession that I questioned gangan that’s wrong or what’s up there is wrong too?

I just wan know

Man should take some rest please

7/19/22, 10:39 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Me I don’t know the kind of twisting that can make what he wrote up there right.
7/19/22, 10:42 AM - +234 816 463 6464: Is the fact that you are using economic terms to backup that the yeye statement for me 🌚

Afi suuru sha
7/19/22, 10:44 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): As Oga don know say I sabi Economics 😂
7/19/22, 10:44 AM - +234 708 690 0451: That agbado stuff really made me lose interest and Passion that I had To Serve In Nigerian Army.
7/19/22, 10:48 AM - +234 810 206 9268: I go ask you too the question I asked jimcruz

The analysis about those countries and revenue generated from corn are they wrong?
7/19/22, 10:49 AM - +234 810 206 9268: Does increase in the demand of a product not lead to the profitability of the manufacturers of such products?
7/19/22, 10:49 AM - +234 810 206 9268: Why do you people like to bend facts to suits your opinions
7/19/22, 10:50 AM - +234 816 463 6464: You're sounding like those analyst at Newspaper stand for oju-ina in Mushin

Dem go dey force agbado into our mouth or how sir
7/19/22, 10:52 AM - +234 708 690 0451: This Picture Sha💔💔💔💔.

7/19/22, 10:53 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): With coconut o 

I ate it for the first time when I travelled to Lagos for the first time in 2010 😀😂

Before then, I’ve never seen that combo
7/19/22, 10:53 AM - +234 810 206 9268: If this is the only picture that comes to mind when you hear about corn

Then I don’t know what to say
7/19/22, 10:53 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): And na like that e be for other nation’s army 

Right?
7/19/22, 10:54 AM - +234 814 235 8262: Corn 🌽 cornflakes 
Corn and beans
Corn and what again?
7/19/22, 10:54 AM - +234 816 463 6464: The issue here is not the corn export analysis rather using it to justify the statement made by Tinubu.....

The "Agbado nation" wasn't coined based on export but from the statement *"Recruiting 50M youths into the army and feeding them with agbado, corn, ewa for lunch and dinner"*
7/19/22, 10:54 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): It’s the picture of green corn inside fried rice that should come 😂

Or that of ẸWÀ alagbado
7/19/22, 10:54 AM - +234 814 235 8262: Corn to custard 
Corn to pap
7/19/22, 10:55 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Exactly my point which I stressed up there

I don’t know how all of a sudden the narrative want to be twisted 

Are they called  corn nation cos they intend to do any other thing to corn aside feeding our army?
7/19/22, 10:55 AM - +234 816 463 6464: I never said you are wrong with the economic terms but don't insult my discipline by using it to support BAT statement of feeding 50M recruited youth into the army.....

That is the subject matter
7/19/22, 10:56 AM - +234 810 206 9268: Mr Onipede 

Let’s say Bat does as he said

And recruits 50m Nigerians into the army 

And feeds them corn truly

Will the corn market boom

Yes or no?
7/19/22, 10:57 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): God 😂🤣
7/19/22, 10:57 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Omo 😂
7/19/22, 10:57 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): @2347086900451 
I wish you the best in the army
7/19/22, 10:57 AM - +234 708 690 0451: I love Corn oo but saying those stuffs is actually demeaning to the Military.

A Recruit in the Nigerian Army which is Lance Corporal earns nothing more than 50k or a bit 55k and there's nothing like proper renumeration for the non commissioned officers. And all Baba is interested is feeding them with Agbado. It painful
7/19/22, 10:58 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): They have told you pap and custard dey part of corn 😂

Abari Sev dey. Na Yoruba food. E be like moin moin 

Best of luck bro @2347086900451

*Are you asking me a different question or based on the subject matter?*
7/19/22, 10:59 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): No o
You must eat corn so our economy will boom
7/19/22, 10:59 AM - +234 708 690 0451: 💔💔💔. Its heartbreaking seriously.
7/19/22, 10:59 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): <Media omitted>
7/19/22, 10:59 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Other nations where there economy is booming  cos of agbado, are they feeding their army?
7/19/22, 11:00 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Ori mi ti fe daru gaan Sev 

😂
7/19/22, 11:01 AM - +234 810 206 9268: I’m asking you a demand and supply question
7/19/22, 11:01 AM - +234 810 619 9957: Our leaders think less of our ground troops. 

My soldiers at the medical center well camped in the middle of nowhere with no food and water they had to survive themselves with personal funds bike to and fro out of that place was abt 2k so they conteibute money and give one soldier or two to go get their supplies. Spending 2k to go and buy bag of water , imagine.

Bat was vomiting rubbish with that agbado statement not everyone can eat agbado either cooked or roasted as it triggers chest burn for them.

Cassava on the other hand too much of it is excess carbohydrate in the body excess sugar that can trigger diabetes and hypertension.

President want his ground troops to feed on that really?

Which farmers is he claiming are making money is it the ones they made fertilizer to expensive for that as to result to manure and the likes for their crops to go abeg make the man get out
7/19/22, 11:04 AM - +234 810 206 9268: Na sentiments go kill us for this country
7/19/22, 11:04 AM - +234 810 206 9268: I’m not saying raw corn is the best for soldiers
7/19/22, 11:04 AM - +234 810 206 9268: But you should know he was trying to indicate that if we have more soldiers insecurity issues will reduce
7/19/22, 11:06 AM - +234 810 619 9957: Sir you and i know that was just a statement for the public
7/19/22, 11:06 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Torrr
7/19/22, 11:06 AM - +234 810 206 9268: And the corn too na statement for the private???
7/19/22, 11:07 AM - +234 810 206 9268: Our problem is that we sieve out the information we want to peddle and send it out, other things don’t matter
7/19/22, 11:07 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Soldiers fed on corn will have so muchhhhhh energy and enthusiasm to fight insurgents 

Yes. I agree sir
7/19/22, 11:07 AM - +234 703 446 8168: I thought you had something for us, I wouldn’t be disappointed next time.

I taya for una for this group oooo 😂
7/19/22, 11:09 AM - +234 810 206 9268: I’ve mentioned about three things in my argument so far 

The 50m recruits will drop unemployment by a reasonable amount

The food market will also take its share

Insecurity will reduce too

But if eating corn alone  is all you guys can get from that statement na Una know o
7/19/22, 11:09 AM - +234 816 463 6464: "Corn market boom" here is relative.

Our locally supply of maize in the market is not surplus to demand. So recruiting 50M people into the army to feed them corn will increase the demand for corn further and expose the nation more to importation of 🌽 which will further weaken our naira....

Soluade post would have made more sense if his analysis focus more on improving local production of maize but Baba rather match it with countries exporting maize.....

In Q3 of 2020 alone, Nigeria imported 26.6B maize due to production shortfall that quarter

7/19/22, 11:13 AM - +234 810 206 9268: He matched it with exporting maize because you guys were carrying it all around as if Maize has no economical or international value

Do you know the amount of people eating cereal in a day

Do you know cereal is like 90% made of corn?

Corn flakes
Golden morn
Amongst others??

*And let's remain on the subject matter please.... Focus is on feeding our army with corn and the multiplier effect boosting our export for maize*

So my thought on your definition of education sir is backward. The diff between Us and Portable even if we make it on the street is the moral values that comes with education. Not you masking how much he can make with his shenanigans in saying Education is Scam. 

I don’t like book 📖 but I’m educated! No amount of money will take that away from me

You have really ridiculed the Nigeria society and it's very bad.... Shey 1M wa je owo ni for you to say some graduate won't smell it in their entire career or lifetime....

Also, you can never be educated and you will struggle except you wish to be or there is a family curse somewhere

Olamide dropped out of TASUED but have you ever read in the news Baddo behaving in that manner....

Again, it's quite surprising what Values and Morals don turn to in our society...
7/19/22, 2:22 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Shey na my fault say Nigeria dey the position wey we dey? Everyone is trying to find a way in the system to survive.

It's seems you don't know how values and morals have been lost in our society.

Also, you can support Portable misyarn without talking down on Education.....

May I also tell you that regardless of how you want to put it, we're all educated and the only different is the type of education and where it was acquired....

Lastly, stop using the excuses of giran to support his rubbish doings. *The guy should be call to order and visit a Rehab*

7/19/22, 6:46 PM - +234 814 235 8262: #UPDATED - ASUU STRIKE

ASUU National President, Professor Emmanuel Osodeke, briefs reporters on the lingering strike by the union in Abuja on July 19, 2022.
 
The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has insisted that it will not back down on the strike by members of the union across the country, which is currently in its fifth month.

ASUU National President, Professor Emmanuel Osodeke, stated this on Tuesday while briefing reporters in Abuja, the nation’s capital.

Lecturers in government-owned universities embarked on a nationwide strike on February 14 over the adoption of the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS) of the government as the payment system in the university sector.

They had also decried the poor funding of universities, non-payment of salaries and allowances of some of their colleagues, as well as the inability of the government to pay earned academic allowance to lecturers, among other issues.

Since the industrial action began, several negotiations between the union and the government have ended in deadlock.

Amid outcry over the effect of the industrial action on the nation’s tertiary education sector, various individuals and groups have asked the government to find a lasting solution to the crisis.

In his briefing on Tuesday in the nation’s capital, Professor Osedeke said the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige should be blamed for the present situation.

Read the full text of the briefing by the ASUU president below:

Comrades and compatriots of the Press,

It has become imperative for us in the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to update Nigerians and lovers of education everywhere in the world on the status of our ongoing nationwide strike action which began on 14th February 2022. The need for doing so could be traced to two sources. First, as a union of intellectuals that deals with facts and verifiable claims, there is need to put the records straight on our engagements with the government.

This need becomes very compelling against the backdrop of the statements recently pushed out from the government quarters. Specifically, there have been insinuations by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, that there was no agreement between ASUU and the government; that ASUU sat down to fix its own members’ salaries; and that our Union asked representatives of ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to recuse themselves from the negotiations.

Also, it appears that Dr. Ngige has deliberately misrepresented the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) convention on the collective bargaining agreement and the roles of a conciliator to serve his propagandist interest in this matter.

ON AGREEMENT OR NO AGREEMENT

Following the resumption of the strike action by our Union at the University of Lagos, on the 14th February 2022, we participated at several meetings at the instance of the Ministry of Labour and Employment chaired by Dr. Chris Ngige as “Conciliator”. To our utter dismay, nothing concrete came out of the endless deliberations as the Conciliator kept approbating and reprobating. For instance, he would declare that he fully supported our demand that the renegotiation of the 2009 FGN/ASUU be speedily concluded within six weeks while at the same time creating an unrealistic pathway to arriving at a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).

Similarly, Dr. Ngige kept going back and forth on concluding the integrity test for the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) for replacing the discredited Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information (IPPIS) contrary to the letters and spirit of the Memorandum of Action (MoA) of December 2021. Matters got to a head when our Union leaders were forced to express their frustration at one of the so-called conciliatory meetings.

When we expressed our frustration at the manner the engagement processes were going, Dr Chirs Ngige. went on to lampoon the Ministry of Education; saying he was not our employer. At a point, he directed our Union to go and picket the office of the Minister of Education, who is our employer! Subsequently, he tactfully recused himself.

The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), having observed the snail speed and lack of result, threatened and called on the Federal government to set up a high-powered committee to look into the matter. The NLC’s intervention resulted in the “Tripartite-plus” meeting chaired by the Chief of Staff to the President and Commander in Chief, Prof Ibrahim Gambari on 12th May 2022. Contrary to his claim, the meeting that held at the State House Banquet Hall was not convened by the Minister of Labour and Employment.

In fact, Dr. Ngige did everything within his capacity to frustrate the suggestion by the Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III, and supported by the Co-chair of the Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) and President of Christian Association of Nigeria, Revd. Dr. Samson Ayokunle, that the embargo placed on university workers’ salaries be lifted to pave way for amicable resolution of the crisis.

For the avoidance of doubt, at no point did ASUU say the President and Commander-in-Chief was going to sign any agreement between us and the government. What we said was that our Draft Agreement was receiving attention by the President. Our claim about a Draft Agreement was predicated on the fact that it was the second document to be produced by a joint Renegotiating Committee of the 2009 FGN/ASUU Agreement comprising representatives of MDAs and the ASUU team.

The first draft was coordinated by Emeritus Prof. Munzali Jibril, who took over the Chairmanship of the joint renegotiating committee from Dr. Wale Babalakin. That draft was submitted in May 2021 but was rejected by the government a year later! The second and current report was arrived at after the government’s team was reconstituted in April 2022 under the Chairmanship of Emeritus Professor Nimi Briggs.

The Briggs-led Renegotiating Committee began their work with extensive consultations with heads of relevant units in the MDAs and shared a written submission of their findings with our union. We were reassured then, that the new committee had a clear mandate to review the Munzali-led committee’s report through a collective bargaining process. It was that process that produced a Draft Renegotiated Agreement on 16th June 2022.

The government team was expected to present the draft document to its principal as done a year earlier. ASUU did not expect the President of the Federal Republic to sign the document because neither the 2009 Agreement under review nor any of the previous ones were signed directly by the Head of the Government.

What we said and we are saying is that the government team was expected to obtain the needed clearance to sign the Draft Agreement which came out of a collective bargaining process that began way back in 2017! If Dr. Ngige means well as a “conciliator”, why will he be putting roadblocks on the path to completing a process that has dragged on for more than five years?

LABOUR MINISTER AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

The Ministry of Labour and Employment, as the chief labour ministry of the country, is principally expected to apprehend disputes between employers and employees with a view to settling such disputes. The Ministry shall normally await reports of disputes by either side to the disputes for settlement. When the Minister apprehends a dispute, he/she must communicate to the parties or their representatives, his or her own proposal for the resolution of the dispute.

However, ASUU has always had serious reservations about the claim of “conciliation” by someone who has taken sides in the dispute, or by an unabashed protagonist in the crisis such as the current Minister of Labour and Employment. It is antithetical to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions (98, 151 & 154) on collective bargaining and tripartism.

It is against the principle of natural justice and the doctrine of equality for Dr. Ngige who carries himself as if he has personal scores to settle with ASUU and shoots down the Union everywhere it matters to assume the role of conciliator.

The Trade Dispute Act, the principal legislation for labour relations, does not empower the Minister to assume the office of conciliator. This is to guarantee the principle of ‘’good faith’’ in negotiations, which implies making every effort to reach an agreement, conducting genuine and constructive negotiations and applying them in good faith. A collective agreement is between an employer or group of employers or representative agent, on the one hand, and one or more workers’ organisation on the other.

To the extent that the Federal Government, through the Ministry of Education, empanelled the Emeritus Prof. Nimi Briggs committee to negotiate on its behalf with university-based Unions in Nigeria, the purpose of which is to create and agreement between the parties, that committee is the representative agent of government. Any resolution(s), reached by the parties, such as draft agreements, are then to be ratified by the authorised signatories on behalf of the parties to achieve a binding collective bargaining agreement.

ASUU, therefore, makes bold to say that the Minister of Labour and Employment has taken upon himself the role of unabashed protagonist in our ongoing dispute with the government of Nigeria for some inexplicable reasons. Dr. Ngige earlier told whoever cared to listen that he was not the employer of university academics and advised the union to march to the Ministry of Education. Nigerians may wish to know why he has suddenly turned around to constitute himself into an impediment to an amicable resolution of the ongoing crisis.

FUNDING OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES

Comrades and compatriots, it has become the pastime of government officials to talk tough about billions and trillions of naira whenever the thorny issues of education and health sectors’ funding come up for mention. However, it is common knowledge that various sums of money in the same region which could have been deployed for human capacity development and public good usually develop into the thin air at the end of the day!

We are therefore not surprised the leadership of the Ministry of Labour and Employment could condescend to the point of denigrating the import of massive injection of fund into the University Education sub-sector as they tried to miserably dismiss the vexed issue of funding Nigerian public universities and uplifting the country’s intellectual capital. While government and its agents, would like to look at the issue in the ‘’here and now’’ and funding as a one-off matter, we prefer to look at it longitudinally.

ASUU believes that the idea of availability of funds is a dynamic process. For instance, government can mobilize funds from different sources including non-budgetary outlets like stamp-duty, GSM and alcoholic taxes.  These were parts of our recommendations at the National Workshop organised by the Federal government on sustainable funding of education in Nigeria, held between 27th and 28th November, 2018, at the Banquet Hall of the State House in Abuja.

At the workshop, MDAs were also challenged to remit, for the purpose of raising budgetary profile, excesses that accrue and not accounted for.  We insist that, until and unless these sources of ‘loose funds’ are pooled and appropriated in support of education funding, Nigerian Universities will not be positioned to compete globally as well as develop and attract local and foreign grants.

The Minister of Education admitted at the Inter-Ministerial Retreat in November 2017 that Nigeria was lagging behind less endowed African countries in terms of investment in education. In his words “None of the E9 or D8 countries allocates less than 20% of its annual budget to education”. In the last seven years of the outgoing government the country’s annual budgetary allocation have not gone beyond eight percent! Is this progress?

We are appalled by the recent calls by top government functionaries at both federal and state levels to establish more universities at a time agencies run by same Chief Executives are tightly squeezed for funding. The little that is available is thinly spread across many tertiary institutions with minimal impact.

Many heads of tertiary institutions in the country would not hesitate to confess that their universities polytechnics and colleges would have gone under but for the existence of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund). We restate our opposition to the proliferation of universities and other tertiary institutions merely for political gains or electoral value. Nigerians should read through the intentions of hypocritic political jobbers when dangling the carrots of siting institutions they have no intention of developing to compete with others in Africa and beyond.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

ASUU appreciates some recent efforts by critical stakeholders across the broad spectrum of the Nigerian society to resolve the logjam and restore normalcy on our university campuses. The initiatives of the NLC and its affiliate unions are quite commendable. But it is not over until it is over! We also acknowledge the interest of political actors in various groups and platforms who have promised to wade in.

ASUU’s doors of engagements are wide open to all, but we remain unsympathetic to political party sentiments and blackmail irrespective of where such are coming. For a greater and better Nigeria, education is key. So, we remain focused on our goal of making the Nigerian University system internationally competitive and our getting our products to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with their peers in any part of the world.

We appreciate the teeming Nigerians for identifying with our vision in this respect. We specifically acknowledge the support and sacrifices of our students (including our members who are running their postgraduate programmes) as well as their parents; they are our critical partners in this transformation project. We in ASUU shall do our utmost best not to let you down.

Compatriots of the Press, ASUU appreciates your concerns and sympathetic support. We are as bothered as you are because we share a common interest in the Nigeria project.

However, ASUU shall continue to be guided by the sacred canons of integrity, objectivity, and responsibility to which both academics and media practitioners subscribe.  It is our fervent hope and desire that the current groundswell of interests would culminate in a convergence of solutions to this avoidable crisis in the overall interest of Nigeria. Together, we shall win.

The struggle continues!

Thank you.

Emmanuel Osodeke

President

You've No Shame, Your Role In The Nullified 2006 Impeachment Still Hunts You– Oyo PDP Carpets Folarin, Congratulates New Deputy Gov. Lawal

The ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo state has described a statement credited to Senator Teslim Folarin over the impeachment of the former governor, Rauf Olaniyan as a macabre dance of shame unexpected of someone holding such public office.

Folarin in his reaction to what the Oyo state PDP described as the most peaceful and rancour free Impeachment in the history of Nigeria had condemned the state House of Assembly as well as the 7-man judicial panel of investigation constituted by the Chief Judge (CJ) of the state, Justice Munta Abimbola saying the erstwhile deputy governor would be vindicated at appeal court.

The ruling PDP in Oyo state in a press statement today July 20 by the party's state Publicity Secretary, Akeem Olatunji, said such expression is not of optimism but of reckless boasting that is more preemptive of the court than expression of hope saying Folarin was part of the most notorious, controversial, illegal and eventually nullified impeachment in the history of Oyo state in 2006.

Consequently, the party said the impeachment which did not only satisfy the provisions of the Nigerian Constitution also has the full backing of the people of the state who willingly handed the PDP it's mandate  for a period stipulated by law.

According to the press statement, Senator Folarin's role in the nullified 2006 impeachment has perpetually placed the senator on the wrong side of history and posterity will continue to hold him to account because of the grave impact the illegality has had on the political landscape of Oyo state.

Describing the senator's comment as good radiance to bad rubbish, the ruling party said Folarin has continued to conduct himself as a man lacking in personal dignity and honour with brazen show of unremorseful attitude for the 2006 atrocity on the people of Oyo state.

The party explained further that the likes of Folarin may only continue to smell the Governor's Office from a far distance if they fail to repent from the political hooliganism and rascality brazenly displayed in a civilized society noting that any man to be entrusted with the number one seat in the state must be a man of unquestionable character and record.

Mocking the Oyo state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) over its internal crisis, the ruling party advised the Folarin faction of the opposition party to note that every word and action it is taking in the name of playing opposition against the masses government are being noted by civil servants, artisans, market men and women, business operators who are eagerly awaiting to renew the current mandate come 2023.

"It is not only sad but also unfortunate that someone holding such public office as senator of the federal republic of Nigeria could use his political naivety, ignorance, and sheer brazen disregard for history, reduce the highly respected office of a senator.

"Do we have to keep reminding this Senator Of how he and his cohorts in 2006 supported the worst, most notorious, illegal and eventually nullified impeachment in the anal of Oyo state history? it is just 2006 and he and his likes in the Oyo state APC are already feigning short mindedness about the political brigandage, rascality and recklessness they participated in that has had grave negative impacts on development of our political landscape?

"Folarin in his desperation to become governor will easily jump on anything anywhere that is readily against the present government and also acting like someone with respect for decorous political conducts, good conduct and character. The world know him for exactly who he is, which earned him the popular nickname as 'Mr jagba' which translates forceful snatch of what doesn't belong to you.

"In a more saner society, such a man may only be able to earn himself a career in the comedy business. Certainly not in a serious business as either lawmaking or governance. He is a misfit and can do anything just to get political power by every means possible.

"The pulse around town since the entire process of impeachment lasted, was that of a maximum backing of the people with whom ultimate power to give mandate lies. In fact, the removal of the former deputy governor, Rauf Olaniyan from office following established impeachable offenses against him, can pass as the most peaceful and rancour free in the history of Nigeria.

"In 2006 when a very popular former governor was illegally impeached with the support from the likes of Folarin, the entire state was thrown into darkness, an era we pray never to witness again in our collective history. That era witnessed the most horrendous period of brazen illegality, political rascality, and brigandage, and so unfortunately, it still such a man like Folarin that's speaking in public.

"Folarin, a politically empty individual has been the a man that can safely pass as the most opportunistic politician of this era. The first two times he served in the Senate was entirely on late baba Adedibu's sole support. His current place in the Senate was purely a product of the Buhari tsunami which every serious politician in the state can attest to so, we urge Folarin and his likes to continue in that self delusion till we hit the polls in 2023, it'll be like APC didn't even participate at all." The PDP stated.

The party however, congratulates the newly sworn in deputy governor, former Attorney-general of Oyo state, Barrister Bayo Lawal, urging him to continue in his usual self of humility, meekness, friendliness, loyalty, and strong character saying posterity will always be kind to him for making Oyo state proud.

If we say we don't want to eat AGBADO, we have our reasons.
7/20/22, 11:59 AM - +234 703 446 8168: It’s a problem with the state executives and leaders…

Look at that person talking, you’d notice he’s a member loyal to Oyetola but have no problem with TOPS (AREGBE’s faction).

See how he analysed TINUBU’s visit to everybody who contested the primaries.

The problem is just one BASHIR…If he (Oyetola) can see beyond his nose, a way forward for the state APC
7/20/22, 11:59 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): What’s this again 😂
7/20/22, 12:01 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Generating such revenue is not a bad idea...but the designation na the problem

7/20/22, 2:43 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEW ELECTORAL ACT!!!

You should note and know the following:

1. No manual accreditation.

2. No use of incident forms.

3. All accreditation is electronic.

4. Accreditation is Bimodal meaning facial recognition and finger printing.

5. No pre-election cases after conclusion of Elections..

6. No election cases after swearing into office of the winner.

7. All results must be uploaded to INEC official website at the polling units before taking it to the ward, constituency,LGA or state collation center.

8. If the number of votes cast is more than the accredited voters the polling unit result is cancelled.

9. No more agreement between parties to share the remaining ballot papers that were not used.

10. No more massive thump printing and stuffing of ballot boxes. If you like go and steal ballot boxes you are wasting your time. You cannot change the result.

The people's votes are counting now. If you didn't serve the people well when in public office or you are not popular (i.e the people interest centred), save your money because they will collect your money and vote against you.
7/20/22, 2:43 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): So una dey do number 10? 😂🤣

7/20/22, 6:33 PM - +234 905 302 0945: Yoruba people are very good in destroying there Stars sa.
We have 3 leading presidential candidates in the 2023 election as at now. Atiku, Tinubu and Obi. 
The record of Atiku as attested to by Obasanjo his boss on how he sold Nigeria assets to himself  and his cronies is an open secret. 
But have you seen any Northerner taking him to the cleaners?,
Capital no.Obi used his State money and invested it in his family business.
Anambra State under his regime couldn't  boast of tangible infrastructure. 
It was under his regime that 
Yoruba and Hausa people living in Anambra were given quit notice to go back  to their States. This was the reason why Fasola retaliated then. Before now Nigeria is a Zoo country that must be destroyed according to IPOB . 
During the EndSars protest,
Kanu gave instruction to his Ibo boys  to destroy  everything  in Lagos but  no pin was destroyed in any part of Iboland. 
Since Obi entered the presidential race,the ibos have gone frenzy in their support for him both old and young. 
What do we have in Yoruba land?.
Tinubu is a rogue, all his family members are draining the money meant for the country as if he did not have any investment. 
To our Yorubas,Tinubu should be destroyed at all cost.
At times we are totally blindfolded that we can not see any good thing from our Yoruba kinsman. 
When other tribes in Nigeria protect there own we always take ours to the slaughter lab to be killed.
If Tinubu is destined to rule Nigeria by God,our pull him syndrome can not stop him. 
We only  need to learn and protect our race. 
If Obi is elected president of Nigeria today, interest of Igbo will be first protected ditto to Atiku as Fulani interest will be on the front burner.
Let us continue with our oye akotileta and see where it is going to land us in 
Yorubaland. The igbo have taken  every available commercial space in Yorubaland through our greediness  and lack of foresight. 
Tell me how many Yoruba are making exploits in igboland? they will not allow you to even own a percil of land there.
We will come to reality of life when we would have lost everything because of our hatred for ourselves !!!☹️

They are making you all stupid and dumb and portraying y’all to us as unintelligent. 

APC went to hire Bishops? APC wore Catholic robe for fools on the street. I even see a female among them. Catholic dey get female priest? Catholic dey ordained married female?

Religion is not important in choosing President and VP but they went to borrow Pastors? 

At this point, if you still support this show of shame, you should never be educated in the first place! It will be better you’re just quiet on this issue than display your ignorance.

Do you know Oyo state govt charges 20k on Micra & Napep and 11k out of that money is for emission and basket.

Currently being discussed on jazz FM, 100.1 and Labour chairman in Oyo state just said over the phone that; “if they can afford to buy keke maruwa, they should be able to afford 20k charges.”


It is right cos it’s PDP and SEYI MAKINDE’s govt…though taxation is right but not good when it’s extreme.

When we say “humanity has no religion and political party,” we know what are saying.
7/21/22, 7:53 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): 20k monthly or lifetime 20k 

And for your information sir, collecting money from emission started during Ajimobi. 😂 I know very very well. What I don’t know is how much they were charging then
7/21/22, 7:57 AM - +234 816 463 6464: Which one is basket again bayii 😹

What is obtainable now is that any power that is generated must be put on the national grid for transmission and distribution.

7/21/22, 1:40 PM - +234 701 829 9983: I don't know

I don't want to sound defensive, but, The rate at which she will cook now will be different from when they were still dating...So i feel the demand is now higher....

She's the only one that knows the reason she's doing all that

Irrespective, No be to siddon with Tiktok from morning till night without giving her husband food
7/21/22, 1:41 PM - +234 909 214 2313: Exactly my point dear, how can you wake up early morning Nd post on Instagram, TIKTOK without doing your primary duties😂😂😂
7/21/22, 1:42 PM - +234 903 224 4825: This is where religion and all this meditation helps. Religions and humanity teaches us to be ideal, composed, genuine, loving, compassionate and all. 

By nature and God's design, men could think ahead of women, could foresee an impeding danger, etc. Let's be proactive to react and caution ourselves when necessary and when we perceive stuffs like that. 

I'm comfortable with her watching Korea movie because over 50% of what they do is love love. I'm concerned about other contents she watches and divulge. Because it's not her freedom alone to do those things, tbe orientation and contents she inject matters to me, it affects me. Once I notice a kind of contention or sort of harmful orientation about her, I  resume to lecture ni and we talk it off until I'm convinced she understands how harmful that thing is. And I won't be authoritative or bossy about it. I share calmly, with humlity and instances why she must understand. On religious creeds, social lives, ethics, etc. She does same for me and I genuinely give a sense of decency and decorum to make her know truly that I heard, and will change where necessary. 

They all matter. My life, hers and our fruits is in the line. The peace of our lives, our neighbours, the Society we live, too.

7/21/22, 1:45 PM - +234 903 224 4825: We, men. Them, women and ladies aren't doing what our parents does. We are too enlightened, too civilised, too widen in scope and exposure to do them. We aren't submissive. We aren't. We can't submit ourselves to due process. A kan baje naturally. All those things we overlook count and reflect in our personal, social, educational, religious, etc etc. Seriously!

7/21/22, 10:25 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Why were they not asked to prove it then?

Nothing more, nothing less

7/21/22, 10:33 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): If 3k were sacked 

Makinde recalled 1,800
Ajimobi recalled 1,400

So where are the ghost workers the process exposed gangan?
7/21/22, 10:34 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Abi na ghost worker Seyi Makinde recall?

7/21/22, 10:35 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Explain
7/21/22, 10:36 PM - +234 703 446 8168: @2348164636464
Makinde na Weray…He took everybody more like pardon and it’s politics 

And let me remind you…the just impeached governor was a civil servant under Ajimobi and was fired for stealing and some stuff.


Makinde took him in, played politics to appease people like you…

Now the old thief was impeached by Makinde for gross misconduct, abuse of office and stealing among others!

Some credit to AJ for discovering a thief Makinde was blind to.
7/21/22, 10:37 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Are you even sure of the Data
Can you verify the numbers of affected people and those recalled in real terms....

Also remember that the system is only -100% okay
7/21/22, 10:37 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): He called back ghost workers?
7/21/22, 10:37 PM - +234 703 446 8168: AJ was recalling them in batches…

Makinde called back everybody…

Even those that didn’t have tallying certificates
7/21/22, 10:38 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I want to know 

So we can move to what ghost worker itself means
7/21/22, 10:38 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): 😂 
Makinde called back everybody 😂😂😂😂

Baba Ogbon, just go and sleep
7/21/22, 10:38 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Called back everybody but her mum has not been called back
7/21/22, 10:39 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Na Baba Ogbon dey give data not me 

Direct this question to him
7/21/22, 10:39 PM - +234 703 446 8168: You don’t get my point 


Ghost workers were weeded…gone forever

A lot of persons with names not tallying were affected…

Over 2k were ghost workers

A good number had issues of names

Some of the last category were called back by AJ When they were able to prove their names and certs

Makinde called back the rest
7/21/22, 10:39 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Na him know say na 3k
7/21/22, 10:40 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): How many people did the process affect in total?
7/21/22, 10:41 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Na direct question o 

Ko need epistle rara
7/21/22, 10:42 PM - +234 703 446 8168: I can only tell you what I see online, I don’t work in that department…


You said your dad have the data of people from your LG , he can help gather for the 32 other LG nAh
7/21/22, 10:42 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): How many people did you see online?
7/21/22, 10:43 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): As for your last paragraph, I’ll ignore
7/21/22, 10:43 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Point is…

AJ was weeding ghost workers and some persons with not tallying names got affected 

E called some of the last category and GSM is calling the rest or called the rest
7/21/22, 10:43 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Rara o 
We must take it one by one
7/21/22, 10:43 PM - +234 703 446 8168: I don’t mean to disrespect you or dad oooooh!

I’m sorry if you feel offended, my apologies.

No disrespect man
7/21/22, 10:44 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): How many people did you see online? 

How many were ghost workers that are gone forever?

How many did Ajimobi recall?

How many did Seyi recall?
7/21/22, 10:44 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Your point was he was sacking people anyhow and randomly 

I cut your cap and bluff and told you the reason was cos of ghost workers weeding which you argued

I made you see he called some (in batches), Makinde called some

Number in real time, I dunno
7/21/22, 10:45 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Isiak Ajimobi 

You have Isiaq Ajimobi in just one of your many certificates

It’s automatic sack 

What a good process to discover ghost workers
7/21/22, 10:45 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Was it not anyhow?

Was it not randomly?
7/21/22, 10:46 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Even wrong arrangement of name led to PDP ruling in Bayelsa state as of now

It is what it is
7/21/22, 10:46 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): If it wasn’t, why do we have a whooping 1,800 recalled back even by him that did the sacking?
7/21/22, 10:46 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): It wasn’t arrangements 😂 

He simply had different names in different documents 

Your comparison no enter
7/21/22, 10:47 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Not anyhow…

Not randomly…

Just people with wrong names, fake certificates, backdate of age and other petty fraudulent acts…

The people in all categories with prove other than ghost workers were called back by AJ & GSM called others
7/21/22, 10:47 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): You sacked 3k

You recalled 1,800 cos they were sacked wrongly 

Out of 3k

And it’s not anyhow 😂🤣
7/21/22, 10:47 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Why were they not allowed to prove before being sacked
7/21/22, 10:48 PM - +234 703 446 8168: It’s not cos they were able to prove it with court documents (sworn affidavits and co)
7/21/22, 10:48 PM - +234 703 446 8168: You would give them 2/3 days ultimatum ni!

E lorrr sunn!

And why are you falling in line now when “it was not weeding of ghost workers?”
7/21/22, 10:49 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Adeyi-Eremienyo to Degi-Eremienyo
7/21/22, 10:49 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): How is this same name
7/21/22, 10:49 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Is Oluwafemi MORADEYO 

And Oluwatosin MORADEYO

Same?
7/21/22, 10:49 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): This is Bayelsa’s case
7/21/22, 10:49 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Quite different
7/21/22, 10:50 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Moradeyo Ifedayo Johnson

Johnson Moradeyo Ifedayo 

The two above are different persons
7/21/22, 10:50 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): 2/3 days ultimatums to prove or what?
7/21/22, 10:50 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Can you contest this in the bank 🌚
7/21/22, 10:50 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): They are not

7/21/22, 10:51 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Even NYSC accepts this 😂🤣
7/21/22, 10:51 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): And your account should be closed immediately 

Right?
7/21/22, 10:52 PM - +234 703 446 8168: Of course, you will be denied until you can defend it legally
7/21/22, 10:52 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): My bank accounts have different arrangements of name 

Even BVN accepts it
7/21/22, 10:52 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Even NIN
7/21/22, 10:52 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Until then, no be you get that account ba? 
It will be transferred to someone else 

Right?
7/21/22, 10:53 PM - +234 703 446 8168: No ooooo


If it allows or specifies order of arrangement 


If it’s sane order of arrangement and you put that above, they are different
7/21/22, 10:53 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): 😂
7/21/22, 10:53 PM - +234 816 463 6464: You will be denied access till you rectify it....

Your next question will be: Why are they not given time and I will say; it's DOA
7/21/22, 10:53 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Make I paste 2 of my accounts for you?
7/21/22, 10:53 PM - +234 703 446 8168: That was why the job was waiting for them
7/21/22, 10:53 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): What’s DOA gangan?
7/21/22, 10:54 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Dead on Arrival
7/21/22, 10:54 PM - +234 810 206 9268: ❌❌
7/21/22, 10:54 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Of course
It did 

It’s why some are still begging to be called back 

Maybe they don’t have the proofs yet ba? 

Probably you should be sacked for few months. Shebi your job is waiting?
7/21/22, 10:55 PM - +234 703 446 8168: How can I make you see beyond your nose


IF GT says LAST NAME, FIRST NAME, OTHER NAME

and First bank says FIRST NAME, OTHER NAME, LAST NAME

Of course it will be arranged otherwise but if dem born you well use GT arrangement for First bank
7/21/22, 10:55 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I mean NYSC’s account opening

7/22/22, 8:57 AM - +234 817 014 8364: Any president ready to fix our Debt to Revenue ratio must take harsh decisions and wean Nigeria off subsidies and call the bluff of  the NLC, an archaic socialist group of old men 

1. Remove fuel subsidy: fuel will sell between 300 - 400 per litre.
2. Expand VAT coverage:

3. Remove forex subsidy and allow the Naira to trade at its value and focus on exports that will earn us revenue.
Grant Universities and Polytechnics Autonomy and wean ASUU and other Staff Salaries off FG books. Let the Universities pay their staff. Keep the subsidy for technical colleges and primary and post primary education. Use TETFUND as support / create a scholarship fund system.

7/22/22, 10:12 AM - +234 903 224 4825: When we have a daring leader, that's genuinely daring for change and effect growth and development, citizens will call his bluff, including those running theories on what a good leader should do to be good. Maybe you, maybe me. 

But we must encourage these healthy discuss beyond partisan political lines and understand that some decisions are actually drastic, should effect painful reactions from the citizenry to encourage growth in the real sense of it. 

A leader who pander on mob, opinions isn't capable of all those things. 

If you would watch New Amsterdam, it's an American episodic series. We could see how and why it is necessary for any leader to be daring and genuine at it. One of the reasons I love Nasir El-Rufai and Abiola Ajimobi. 

Also and most importantly, we need to see when a decision is being taken for greater good. I'm comfortable with long term solutions, even if it'll take 10 years to manifest, so far the path to it is judiciously managed and followed to its cause.
7/22/22, 10:13 AM - +234 813 948 8163: I’m interested too

7/22/22, 10:19 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Yes. We need a taint of autocracy to make things work. 

Democracy is the worst system of government. The ONLY THING is identify with is the choice and will of the MAJORITY. And the majority can be foolish, stupid and insensitive making decisions. 

Democracy do not transcend beyond making Majority voice heard. Democracy do not translate to good governance, better welfare, social packages and security, etcetera etcetera. No. 

But it is believed that the choice of majority could bring all those. Alas, how true? We are still battling with it. 

There is this Professor, I've forgotten his name, I can check. He was the only one that agreed in a conference held in UI many years back that Nigeria and Africa isn't ripe for democracy, yet. And it is not and possibly would never be the suitable mean of governance for us. 

Let's also check, the best of roads and many infrastructural reforms in this country were during military era. No nonsense due process, legislative approval, or one bureaucracy. Just get things done and working.
7/22/22, 10:22 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Unfortunately, Chief Obasanjo had opportunity, but he didn't have the courage to call the bluff and dare the consequences. Because what? We will all talk. 

And, if and only if they can be genuine, that honesty and interests to make things work matters, - only if, what Dr Jonathan did with fuel subsidy in 2012 could be right if the road map and forgoing initiatives is followed by the machineries of government. The electric bus, etc. You remember?
7/22/22, 10:26 AM - +234 816 463 6464: From your last paragraph, do we now agree that 2 terms is not enough to make a drastic change in the country....

POV: Rwanda that some are running to for vacation now was nothing of such before now
7/22/22, 10:31 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Sure, no cap!

Instead of OBJ to effect deregulation, he went to national televisions to be sensitising people (a good move), do advert on why should deregulate (a better move), do jingles on that too (the best move)…

Did he proceed with the deregulation?

NO, he doesn’t have the gut to!

Instead, baba and his vice went on to check alternatives by privatising some of the national assets, NITEL, NEPA, among all.

NASIR EL RUFAI remains the greatest that dares to step on toes for the bigger good.
7/22/22, 10:34 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Two terms is never and will never be enough, sir. Never. Who even in the first instance says a two term of four years is the acceptable and global standard for democratic assembly? The West of course. The America! 

But and very importantly, there must be an apparatus to check the excesses of leaders in power. See for example Russia, Vladimir Putin will stay as President for a long time, they're not subscribing to the democracy bullshit. But he's keeping himself in check and according to the will of the Russian people and her government. 

See also, China and India as examples of democracy and autocracy. 

China and India are almost a par in terms of population. They both have over 1 billion in population.

India is the largest democracy in the world. China is the largest autocracy in the world. 

China is way ahead of India on most economic, development, wealth, human development indices, et al.

The reason is obvious. Democracy engenders too much unnecessary, toxic, paralysing, divisive debates. Too much. I hate it. But unpopular and people aren't willing to listen or subscribe to it. 

Imagine all or most business decisions being subject to democratic unanimity? There will never be progress! Abi how ?

Mallam will be a better President. Better than a Buhari, an Osinbajo, a Tibunu, etc. He remain the best Minister of FCT. Do anything anyhow. But for progress sake. And be sincere about it. Don't care whose toes is being stepped on. Don't care what citizens will say, of course, if you demolish their shops to be cited elsewhere to build road or hospital, they'll talk. You don't appease the majority because there is nothing ever that can appease us. And we can all see the effects. How beautiful Abuja city is today remain his only effort. Others that came after him are just doing nonsense, doing the bidding of the moneybags and bigwigs. 

We need leaders that are developmental orientated. Who doesn't need to read much briefs to act. Just the details and important thing.

7/22/22, 10:47 AM - +234 903 224 4825: The tagline for democracy is so beautiful - power to the people. But with great power comes great responsibility.

Thinking about this helped to appreciate democracy much more in some instances. If the majority of us are wrong and make bad and unfortunate electoral choices, then maybe we deserve whatever consequence we get. 

The principle of the majority is so powerful and as well delicate and risky. Because it can only be overturned after the prescribed years of service. 

The sense of accountability, not just to those who like you, but also to your rivals is the most potent tool to hold any leader accountable. 

Every time I worry about how our political leaders in Nigeria across all party lines do not prioritise human development issues such as nutrition, health, education, social investment, etc. Then I think again, is there a grassroots demand for these things? Do Nigerians really want this kind of development? We can all answer to that intellectual warriors. 

You see Nigerians compare their country with Dubai, they have skyscrapers and whatnot. But you hardly hear of comparisons with Ireland (which has the 2nd highest HDI in the world), Norway, or even Algerie (which ranks in the top 100). 

We want the shiny and very glamorous stuffs, and our politicians understand this so they give it to us. Even if that means that children will continue to die of hunger, and one in every 2000 births result in the death of either the mother or the child. We would rather they build big, shiny hospitals than invest in the small primary health centers in our communities. We hate unemployment, yet love it when our favorite Governor shows "toughness" by destroying businesses. 

Then we observe our electoral choices! We claim not to want certain kinds of leaders, yet we glorify the exact kind of politics that breeds them. "Grassroot man" "master strategist". And to those we admit have good intentions? "oh, he needs to learn real politics" From who? Me or you? The master strategist whose policies have made you poorer and quite literally killed us?

Democracy is not just about making choices. It is also about holding ourselves responsible for our choices. Because in the end, the politicians will always tell us and do whatever it is they believe will get them our votes. 

So what do we really want? Competence? Vision? Character? Integrity? Leaders that will take the hard and painful decisions for a longterm gain or otherwise? Or the man who knows how to "play real politics". Politics is Afterall, all about your interest, and there are only two sides to it - for your interest, or against your interest.
7/22/22, 10:49 AM - +234 817 014 8364: On this, I want a one term tenure of 6years.

This current terms are merely for ceremonies and most part electioneering. Politicians rarely have time to govern cuz they will always think of next election
7/22/22, 10:49 AM - +234 703 446 8168: @2349032244825 

Democracy thrives and has eaten us deep cos of our history as a people…


The younger generations are oblivious to the fact that those portrayed to us by history as heroes are actually not

They all clamoured for that independence too early. Why?

There were only a few of them with sound education…they could count themeslves across the country then.

They have enticed our ancestors with giving stipends and they never saw beyond that democracy. That made them hated the military rule so much.

The keep them poor, nepotism and divisive politics didn’t start now…it was during Awolowo’s time they kill children and dump their remains behind the house of the opposition (the reason for “politics is a dirty game”).


OBJ saw the need for an extension of power in 2007 and needed additional 4 years but we were all mad at him cos we thought to ask what he was doing in the past 8.

Make we no lie, autocracy/military rule may be a better alternative to saving this country

7/22/22, 11:01 AM - +234 813 948 8163: *scamming
7/22/22, 11:04 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Leader, in 1999, many of those who fought and advocated for democracy abstained from the process, citing skepticism that the military people weren't really ready to handover power. By the time they were serious, those who believed had gone in into politics and mastered the politicking involved. The skeptics have mostly remained activists, 'hacktivists' and ethnic merchants since then and till today. 

I am at my corner laughing at the debates over the electoral act/law et al as the silver bullet and the only solution to all political and electoral party problems in Nigeria. 

I read during the military era, how multi-party democracy was being touted as the panacea to freedom, development, human rights, economic prosperity, etc. We have more than 20 political parties today. Today, anybody can run for any office. 

Another time, some people said it was independent candidacy that was the silver bullet. How many knows that in the new electoral law, there's room for Independent Candidacy? A private citizen, me and you can run for office of Nigeria President without any political party? 

We don't know. We are ignorant. We shout too much to even know our demands are being answered. But it is that freedom that'll frustrate us out of it. 

Many of those that theoritise that Independent Candidacy has pitched tent with Alh Atiku, Asiwaju Tinubu or Mr Peter Obi. 

Humans whose ways are universally corrupt can never find the ideal system that works because no matter how good, majority don't want to comply. And that majority will complain again. 

Democracy is a system of majority participation, unfortunately, majority abstain while minority participate, either via seeking election or through voting. Those who do not participate want to dictate to those who do.

7/23/22, 9:29 AM - +234 814 235 8262: I'm aware of Umahi's case and was sure he won't be on the ballot. I have severally put out analyses on the new Electoral Act and what caught up with him was one.

No aspirant can get another nomination papers having failed on initial one filled before and no decampee aspirant can contest and become candidate of another political party on two grounds, namely if he had filled nomination forms of his former political party and if he defected less than 30 days to such primary which he new political had submitted the party membership register to INEC for before his arrival.

In the eyes of the current law, Obi, Tambuwal, Akpabio, Umahi, Lawan, Bala and several others who decamped or planning to decamp to another party after filling nominations papers of their previous parties or decamped after their current party had submitted membership registers to INEC or failed initial nomination and gunning for another in the same party, are all not candidates for the elections if INEC, political parties, candidates and aspirants are aware of that side of the law but unfortunately only few that some of us consulted for are reaping the benefits.

Akinloye Oyeniyi, Legislative Consultant and Public Affairs Commentator, Abuja.
7/23/22, 9:38 AM - +234 814 235 8262: @2347034468168 @2349032244825 @2348163162679 @2348106199957 @2348187090967 

I did not really understand this
7/23/22, 9:39 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I bn dey hear am too 

We still need a comprehensive breakdown of the new electoral act
7/23/22, 9:40 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Seems you can’t contest a primary under party A and decamp to contest same position in party B in the same election year
7/23/22, 9:42 AM - +234 810 619 9957: Wow @2348163162679 analysis is actually right from this illustration. Na wa o if that is the case some aspirants fall into this category of decamping and declaring in their new party. Na wa o
7/23/22, 9:43 AM - Safe journey: @2348098664771 i dey here say dey drop Hamzat as deputy

Se na true?
7/23/22, 9:46 AM - +234 903 224 4825: I think this is correct. The new electoral law is something jare. I've read something related to such, too, explained by someone.
7/23/22, 9:47 AM - +234 903 224 4825: In the case of Peter Obi, he joined the party after Labour Party has submitted names of members of the party to INEC. So, he was not a member of LP. His name isn't with INEC as member of the party and that question why he can't be the party flag bearer.
7/23/22, 9:49 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Even, the case with SP Ahmed Lawan, Godswill Akpabio, Dave Umahi and the likes is also questionable. And I think INEC has rejected their candidacy. You can't be on a different ticket of different offices within one or two political parties in the same electoral year. That's good anyway. I love it.
7/23/22, 9:50 AM - +234 903 224 4825: So, I think this is correct. It is the same thing INEC has explained and presented in court when Lawan challenged it.
7/23/22, 9:50 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Adelabu and many in Accord will be affected too
7/23/22, 9:50 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Sure
7/23/22, 9:51 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Except they find one technicalities in the case to rubbish it and contest.
7/23/22, 9:57 AM - +234 810 815 2940: He would be correct if he is aware of the following

1. The names on the membership registration list submitted by each party.

2. If they all obtained and submitted forms in their previous party before decamping to another party

3. If their names were not submitted to INEC by their new parties in the membership registration list
7/23/22, 9:59 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Yes

But did obi and Kwakwaso contest under PDP before decamping?
7/23/22, 10:02 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I’m sure it’s the reason Adelabu did not attend APC’s primary
7/23/22, 10:02 AM - +234 810 815 2940: You are not aware of that info though

Inec or the party didn't release the list of members submitted

We all are guessing his name is not on the list because his membership announcement was a day after the deadline for submission of membership list

Plus INEC witness his Primary In Labour Party and certified him the official candidate
7/23/22, 10:03 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Obi obtained nomination form I think 

Kwankwaso left PDP long before his announcement n tie
7/23/22, 10:03 AM - +234 903 224 4825: But he obtained APC gubernatorial nomination form nah.
7/23/22, 10:04 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Yes
7/23/22, 10:04 AM - +234 903 224 4825: They didn't. But Obi's name isn't in Labour Party members list submitted to INEC.
7/23/22, 10:04 AM - +234 810 815 2940: There's still a lot not clear or even "useable" in the new electoral law because

It was signed way too late.

A law becomes effective from the day it was signed by the president

The whole electoral process has began way before that and the former law was used
7/23/22, 10:04 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): A whole lot o
7/23/22, 10:05 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Do u have a copy of the list?

Who released it for public knowledge?
7/23/22, 10:07 AM - +234 903 224 4825: There is a day Peter Obi denounced his membership of PDP and announced his membership of Labour Party. Those dates matters. At least, he can't be a member of two political parties at a time.
7/23/22, 10:07 AM - +234 903 224 4825: There is a gap of more than a week, if not up to two weeks or three between when Labour Party submitted her members list to INEC and when PO joined the party. Let me try and check.
7/23/22, 10:09 AM - +234 810 815 2940: The deadline from INEC was a day before

INEC gave a room for updates, there may have submitted an updated list.

PO deliberated before choosing Labour party, all that would have been put into consideration

7/23/22, 10:10 AM - +234 903 224 4825: <Media omitted>
7/23/22, 10:10 AM - +234 810 815 2940: I think he joined labour before the law was signed too

Which is a reason to throw the case aware on technicalities
7/23/22, 10:11 AM - +234 903 224 4825: April 25 — The Labour Party submitted list of its registered members to the INEC. 

May 26 — Peter Obi joined the Labour Party.
7/23/22, 10:11 AM - +234 816 463 6464: Bastard 😠
7/23/22, 10:12 AM - +234 810 815 2940: I told you, it's a day after
7/23/22, 10:12 AM - +234 903 224 4825: If we carefully study the Electoral Act 2022 (amended) especially from Sections 78 to 102, we might understand it clearer.
7/23/22, 10:12 AM - Safe journey: Month after
7/23/22, 10:12 AM - +234 816 463 6464: What's this 😂
7/23/22, 10:12 AM - Senate President💎: Send money sir
7/23/22, 10:12 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Better this way

April 25 — The Labour Party submitted list of its registered members to the INEC. 

May 26 — Peter Obi announced he has joined the Labour Party.
7/23/22, 10:13 AM - +234 903 224 4825: If there is a room for update, it can't be within the election and party primaries window.
7/23/22, 10:13 AM - +234 816 463 6464: This message was deleted
7/23/22, 10:14 AM - +234 816 463 6464: Who be Alhaja 🙄
7/23/22, 10:14 AM - +234 810 815 2940: The INEC deadline was on 25th May

They could have been an updated copy
7/23/22, 10:14 AM - +234 903 224 4825: No. The first signing stands. What was amended was those that'll vote in primary, statutory delegates and the likes.
7/23/22, 10:15 AM - +234 810 815 2940: You may be correct though
7/23/22, 10:15 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Peter Obi told us in his tweet when he said he submitted his resignation letter as memeber of PDP. Shey?
7/23/22, 10:15 AM - +234 810 815 2940: But the electoral law was signed too late
7/23/22, 10:16 AM - +234 810 815 2940: The electoral process has started way before it was signed
7/23/22, 10:16 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Which is a reason to dismiss it on technicalities
7/23/22, 10:16 AM - +234 903 224 4825: And he joined May 26.
7/23/22, 10:17 AM - +234 903 224 4825: It was actually signed before the whole electoral process started. It is the National Assembly that ya dindinrin doing an ammendment they didn't notice for their personal gains alone.
7/23/22, 10:18 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Things like that don't happen in a day

@2348118529190 didn't sleep as a Confidence member and wake as an Intellectual Warrior
7/23/22, 10:19 AM - +234 810 206 9268: Shots fired
7/23/22, 10:19 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Electoral process started since last year bro 😂
7/23/22, 10:19 AM - +234 903 224 4825: The courts will sha argue what was amended if it affected the subject in question. 

Check Lawan and Akpabio, they could have faulted the grounds of their disqualification if that technicalities will stand.
7/23/22, 10:20 AM - +234 903 224 4825: That affect candidacy and party primaries. Electoral process as regards 2023 that started last year was about INEC preparation. There's a timetable nah.
7/23/22, 10:21 AM - +234 810 815 2940: So all those money wey Tinubu dey share for victims in the north since last year na just giveaway? 😂

You are correct though, just playing
7/23/22, 10:21 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Yes. I agree. The date he said he leave PDP will then matter. The date he submitted his letter of resignation. Shey?
7/23/22, 10:21 AM - +234 816 463 6464: <Media omitted>
7/23/22, 10:21 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Giveaway ni nah😂
7/23/22, 10:29 AM - +234 816 463 6464: *In the other news, it is looking like Kounde will sign for Barcelona.....*

Congratulations to all Chelsea fans for losing out on this again 🤣.
7/23/22, 10:29 AM - +234 703 446 8168: The day he submitted resignation letter is the he left PDP

The day he picked LP ID is the day he joined LP

The days he announced his resignation in PDP and joining LP doesn’t matter.

Another problem he could have is if he had joined LP before resigning his membership in PDP.

A whole lot of technicalities will be checked but trust me, no party will drag him to court until after the elections.

Furthermore, INEC will be charged not to disqualify him until after the the election cos if he is disqualified, a reason for APC to loose out cos the whole of Nigeria 🇳🇬 will be mad at them and perceive it as APC’s plan.

But at the moment, APC is happy Obi is not in the PDP 😂 

Let’s fold our hands and watch out!
7/23/22, 10:32 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Any average player will pick Barcelona over Chelsea

You must be a very good and confident player to choose Chelsea (a team you need to stand out to even fit in or get play time) over Barcelona (a team that strives on past glory and team strength)
7/23/22, 10:33 AM - +234 810 815 2940: This is giving the Bamidele/Yahya/Harun vibes
7/23/22, 10:33 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Low-key 💯
7/23/22, 10:33 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Yes yes. That's it. I've also noted that the day he submitted his resignation in PDP matters. 

Yes, many technicalities will be checked. 

APC should not play foul by challenging him court pre-election. All his supporters will run to PDP again ni.
7/23/22, 10:33 AM - +234 703 446 8168: He is more likely to pick Barcelona
7/23/22, 10:34 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Mo fe se ise ile. 😢
7/23/22, 10:34 AM - +234 810 815 2940: We had enough ground to disqualify Yahya but we let it go so as to have their votes divided
7/23/22, 10:35 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Yes just like any other average player
7/23/22, 10:35 AM - +234 703 446 8168: APC is low-key a smart politics party.

The are low-key controlling IMO STATE despite coming 2nd Abi 3rd sef at the polls.

Awon Weray yenn sabi technicalities of the law…they only loose when it’s beyond technicalities
7/23/22, 10:35 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Fact 💯

Yet your was everywhere bidding for him 😂
7/23/22, 10:36 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Make them come club wey Dan's fit cancel them after on match 🤣
7/23/22, 10:37 AM - +234 903 224 4825: APC - Progress! ✊🏾
7/23/22, 10:37 AM - +234 703 446 8168: When are you going to start posting ASIWAJU BOLA AHMED TINUBU on your status?

Is it truly APC Power or PYO Power¿
7/23/22, 10:38 AM - +234 810 815 2940: He was end choice, we got the first choice already

So he doesn't matter anymore but the bid was already on the table with Sevilla
7/23/22, 10:39 AM - +234 816 463 6464: I already told you who he is na....

I won't be surprised if he decides not to
7/23/22, 10:40 AM - +234 816 463 6464: Whatever makes you happy 😹
7/23/22, 10:42 AM - +234 810 815 2940: South Africa local cup is playing live on Super Sport but we can not watch our own Major league on any TV.

What will it cost us to standardize and promote our own league 

Nigeria is not the Giant of Africa in my book!
7/23/22, 10:42 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Players wey go still sue you after few months for salary arrears 😏
7/23/22, 10:44 AM - +234 816 463 6464: We're only giant on paper and that was even 10 years ago

Only one journalist have reported the KOUNDE to Barcelona deal.

Just Gerard Romero…we have not seen others report the same, so anything can happen bro
7/23/22, 10:48 AM - +234 810 815 2940: I think we are sleeping on this Khaid Boy.
Man is so good

SydneyTalker for a great signing 👌

7/23/22, 10:51 AM - +234 810 815 2940: He would just come from no where to take the glory because he has more audience
7/23/22, 10:51 AM - +234 703 446 8168: No, that’s not my position…who says I wait for Fabrizio sef?


I am saying we could have had as many of the tops saying something about it.
7/23/22, 10:52 AM - +234 810 815 2940: This transfer window really exposed him

There's nothing he talks abt that is new

Someone else would have been on it for days
7/23/22, 11:00 AM - +234 703 446 8168: Gerard Romero just he’s got KOUNDE final transfer fee but he can’t reveal it.

Dude is so sure.

KOUNDE to Barça is a done deal ✅
7/23/22, 11:00 AM - +234 816 463 6464: But you guys don't need him since he's an average player na

7/23/22, 11:24 AM - +234 810 815 2940: I said he is 2nd choice
We got the 1st choice already
We can get the 2
But if we are to get 1, the first choice is the one we would choose and we got him already
7/23/22, 11:26 AM - +234 810 815 2940: Kounde will only start in a back 3/5

He go chop bench in a back 4 (Silva/Koulibaly surely)

You bully us but you had to go out of your way by pulling out of other deals just to be able to match up Chelsea's bid
7/23/22, 12:23 PM - +234 810 815 2940: People like was glad you had him ahead of my club
7/23/22, 12:23 PM - +234 810 815 2940: Even free Mount has better numbers than him
7/23/22, 12:28 PM - +234 903 749 0597: It’s okay to find comforting words to sooth your souls we did hurt in this transfer window.
It wasn’t only Raphinha, Lewandoski is also another. Btw save us that Mason Mount >>> Raphinha talk abeg 
Your club wanted him, your fans on Twitter trolled barca, claimed y’all was hijacking our deals cause we was broke
7/23/22, 12:28 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): 626

How is that "too"

Meanwhile, Raphina wanted you bcos u are is dream club

You could have got him for 30M but Chelsea bidded 60M so you had to up your bid to 60M too in order to get him

You got a player we have been praying all his life to play for you as his mentor Ronaldinho did too 

But you got him for twice the price you would have paid if Chelsea wasn't involved

But you "too" bully Chelsea
7/23/22, 12:33 PM - +234 810 815 2940: ~We have been~

Tuchel spoke abt him (he is his former coach) and fans started debating getting him since he is free as at then

7/23/22, 10:21 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): REPORT OF THE MEETING WITH THE GOVERNOR OF OYO STATE, ENGR. SEYI MAKINDE HELD ON SATURDAY JULY 23 2022 AT HIS PRIVATE HOUSE, IKOLABA QUARTER, IBADAN

The meeting was facilitated by Dr Ige Saheed Adetunmbi of Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, LAUTECH, Ogbomoso. 

The meeting was very impromptu as we didn't had the notice of it before we received a call at exactly 9.35pm on Friday, July 22, 2022 that all the four chairmen of the University based unions and the students union President should come to Ibadan today Saturday July 23, 2022 to meet with His Excellency at 10.00am to listen to our side of the story on the ongoing strike action in the university.

The Governor was accompanied by his newly sworn - in Deputy Governor, Barr. Bayo Lawal and one time council chairman, Chief (Dr) Ayorinde SAN to the meeting.

The leadership of the unions on campus placed before the Governor all our demands and local agitations that would have made us to embark on an industrial action before the ongoing National strike was called by the National leadership.

Responding, the Governor noted all our demands and approved as follows:

1. That the suspension on the payment of the University monthly subvention is lifted immediately
2. That the council and management would further engage with the unions in order to pay the two months salaries outstanding of May and June 2022
3. That the state government will support the University management to resolve the lingering financial problem facing the institution.
 
We thank God for His grace over our lives.

Aluta continua victoria ascerta.

Few days after he dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC), Otunba Rotimi Paseda has joined the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State.

Paseda, a 2019 governorship candidate in the Gateway State, on Saturday, met with the Deputy Governorship candidate of the PDP in the State, Hon. Adekunle Akinlade.

At the meeting held at his Omu-Ijebu residence, Paseda assured Triple A and former Deputy Speaker, Ogun State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Tola Banjo of his unflinching support for the PDP in 2023.

7/24/22, 5:11 PM - +234 906 762 1398: TASUEDSU APPRECIATE THE  DOGGEDNESS OF TASUEDITES TODAY, URGE ALL TO MAINTAIN CALM AND PEACE IN THE UNIVERSITY

The President of the Students' Union, Olamide Adeboun uses this ample opportunity to laud the spirit of love, resilience, diehard spirit of love and doggedness exhibited by TASUEDITES today.

It is uncommon to see hundred of TASUEDITES to stay by their colleagues to challenge injustice and undue threat on our studentship.

Today, men of Special Anti Robbery Squad(SARS) pursued some sets of individuals believed to be students of our university from Ijebu-Ode to the university community. This is absolutely wrong irrespective of the basis. The university will never harbour criminal and criminal will not attempt to seek solace in the university. 

The act is a gross display of nonprefessionalism and lack of proper training to relate with students community.

In the first place, it is very wrong for any security agency to enter the university community uninvited by the university authority. It become so wrong for them to attempt to initiate arrest within the university without the approval of the university authority.

The university is an institution on its own that have working structures to govern its system of operations. The university have trained and identified security men mainly for the maintenance of our internal security. 

It is at a point of a perceived aggression or incapability to arrest a seeming security challenge within the university that men of Nigerian Police or other security agency of the country can enter the university, and they must be invited still.

Today, men of SARS entered our university uninvited and tried to initiate an arrest on one of us. To worsen the situation, the officers released two rifles from their gun. This is very unethical, threatening and creates tension in an academic environment. TASUEDSU and TASUEDITES will never condole such act, we are not cowards.

For an ideal society that we preach and crave for, the Students' Union condemn this act in all senses. It is barbaric, uncalled for and very threatening to our peace on campus.

We use this opportunity to thank our dear Vice Chancellor, Prof Abayomi Arigbabu for swiftly responding to the situation. Today, he reiterated our belief in him as a standout administrator and responsive leader. We continue to have confidence in his leadership of our university.

TASUEDSU ask men of Nigerian Police and all its unit to exhibit leniency and display of professionalism in attending to students and students community. Students should be safe with Police and not serve as threats. We should not for any reason have anxiety and be apprehensive with the involvement of Police.

Dear TASUEDITES, the Students' Union want to appeal to ever ideological and articulate TASUEDITES to maintain the calmness and peace of the university. It is by doing this that we can all feel proud and be safe as TASUEDITES.

The Students' Union shall continue to represent all TASUEDITES come rain and shine. We shall continue to be at our defense in pursue for justice and equity. We shall continue to stand by TASUEDITES against oppression and any form of aggression. While we do this, we ask TASUEDITES to be cooperating and supportive in sojourn to deliver a TASUED of our wish.

God bless our collective indomitable will. Thanks and God Bless Us All.

Olamide Adeboun
President of the Students' Union

7/25/22, 7:48 AM - +234 703 446 8168: So, the standing WORLD RECORD is 12.12 secs for her.

The wind was illegal at +2.5 m/s, that is, blowing too fast to be eligible for a world record.

The wind can’t blow beyond +2.0 m/s for it to be eligible for a world record.

It’s the standard athletics rule as it applies for 100m/200m/and others
7/25/22, 7:53 AM - +234 703 446 8168: So now I just saw her presentation and they said wind doesn’t matter…

Force musicians/dancers etc to cut their dreads. 
Label everyone yahoo boys 
And even call soldier to arrest them 

But when they blow, you’ll want to post their video with one stupid caption? Mo le gbe yin sepe. Allah 

If you want talents to graduate from your school and hold the school in high esteem, relation on now students are treated and how talents are managed must be worked on.

He published it on the punch newspaper. There’s nothing like attachment. She gained admission to the school, she submitted and pick TASUED. She left when she had scholarship 
Nothing bad here
7/25/22, 9:49 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Is Enactus Tasued not an association in TASUED? Did they not represent TASUED at the competition? 

The Vc Need not be told before doing that in the first place. 
Telling him before knowing what to do is any other evidence our school dey ment 


Therefore, your comparison no follow at all

We will claim them if they are contesting against our own good students.

You know how we will claim them?

We will make them more popular by publishing the verifiable lists of atrocities they made while in school!

Same way we will publish how you are currently demeaning our school when we become great and you want a contract from us at the national level!

Cappish?

                LETTER OF REJECTION.
In response to your letter attached to this piece, due to your unflinching support and tremendous efforts towards the development of our great party (APC), I write to inform you that your resignation letter is hereby rejected.

I cannot afford to lose a vibrant, energetic, assiduous and quintessential member of the progressives like you.

I will be glad retaining your membership in the All Progressives Congress as a party.

Thank you for your understanding.

Yours faithfully,
Hon. Olodu Mutairu O.
Ward 09,
Isokan Local Government.

My best friend slept with my wife, I revenged and dated his teenage daughter who is now pregnant for me” – Man Confess

Im a man aged 35. I discovered that my long time best friend was dating my wife. I have all the evidence . She is 25 years old. We got married and had a white weeding last year in April. My best friend is 45.

My friend of over 15 years has been seeing my wife behind my back. I found out about it last year December. My good friend was always exchanging messages and nude pictures with my wife on Whats App.

I hacked my wife’s phone and thats how i discovered what was happening between them . I dont want to lie guys this broke my heart. I trusted my friend and took him as my own brother.

When i found out i decided not to ask them. Instead I made a desicion to act as if i dont know anything. I wanted to revenge.

My feelings towards my wife changed. I just started acting up and i no longer treat her as i did before . With my friend I am pretending as if all is well.

For my revenge I decided to look for my friends daughter who happens to be a student in one of the Universities close by to my residence. She is 19 years old.

I approached her with the intent of dating her. After a while of trying, I succeeded in having her as my friend and now we have been dating. Im so happy because i actually succeeded. The best part is i have been sleeping with her with no protection. We recently discovered she is now pregnant.

The issue now is she has fallen in love with me to the extent of saying she wants me to marry her. As for me i dont have a problem with that.

As it is Im waiting for the day they will discover that she is pregnant and we exchange i take his daughter and he takes my wife.”

Wetin una advise me for this matter abeg??🤔🤔

APC no go do well in this life and in the hereafter for not gifting the presidential ticket to FASHOLA!

I watched his and PO’s interviews, and I came to the conclusion that FASHOLA is the most/1 one of the few brilliant politicians we have in this country.

Fashola na agba - awo and he is 20 years above the league of PO.

I’m pained to the bone!

7/26/22, 10:08 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): A young man cried in my car last night.

I didn’t first notice as I was still in shock from my near car crash.

I continued work anyway, in case you wan look me one kind 🙄.
I had to, I have bills, I have to drive. Drive to Earn - Drive to spend.
It’s hard! But I nor get choice.

Asa’s “murder in the USA” was the song playing, and if you are a very emotional person who is going through heart and love issues, you nor go know when Asa music go comot tears for your eyes.
I’ve been there before so I fit relate.

I picked the guy man in an estate, he was with a lady just waiting outside the gate for me.

They spent extra 3-4 mins discussing, the guy was more worried with his stance in the conversation.
The girl looked calm but I know say na scam.
I realise say na scam when bros start to shed hot tears.

When I noticed, I asked him, “Chief I hope everything is alright”.

He replied with “I am fine”

I carry face up face road dey drive motor dey go.
On his own, he started with “i fuc.ked up”
“I had a good thing and I ruined it”

Wetin happen o? Make i know how I go take advice you o!
Una nor dey kuku pay consultation fees.
Na free I Dey do am!

Fresh guy!
Well trimmed beards
Arsenal jersey
Nice smell

You go don know say na sure boy wey love just wound.

He opened up finally.

His flight to the Finland for relocation is in few days.
He kept all the processing away from his girlfriend of 3 years.

Telling her few days to travel.
Babe couldn’t take the heartbreak.
She wants to break things before he goes.

My man is saying he wants to marry her.
She gave a strong argument why it won’t work and emphasized on the secret he kept about his travel.

My hand sef fall!
And I told him the truth!

If you loved her as you claim, you won’t keep such thing away from her.

I hope she comes around tho
And if she doesn’t.
Life goes on!

7/27/22, 7:50 AM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Since Tobi Amusan’s rise to stardom 2 days ago, I have not shed tears (I have read many people say they cry while watching her video).
The National Anthem of Nigeria doesn’t move me to the point of tears any longer.

But this morning, few minutes ago, as I went through Tobi Amusan’s Instagram and went to the very first post there (August 2014), I shed tears! I saw her trials and failures over the years and I saw how she didn’t give up till she attained success and peak days ago. 
If you want to see Perseverance, diligence, hardwork in its practical form, you may go through her page. 
The motivation I’ve derived from her this morning is timely! Very! 

Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ) 💯

7/27/22, 4:58 PM - +234 903 224 4825: Impeachment of the President in an APC majority-filled National Association ?
7/27/22, 4:59 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Either it will happen or not, there is an impeachment heat in the house
7/27/22, 4:59 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): And the Senate President just acted as expected
7/27/22, 4:59 PM - +234 810 206 9268: 👍
7/27/22, 5:00 PM - +234 903 224 4825: Lol. What's happening in the NASS isn't even anything compared to the schemes Aminu Waziri Tambuwal led HoR did to Dr Jonathan as President.

Impeachment heat ki tie ni?😂
7/27/22, 5:01 PM - +234 903 224 4825: The Senate had an already scheduled recess o.
7/27/22, 5:01 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Did it tamper with Jonathan and Tambuwal ‘s administration as President and Speaker respectively or not?
7/27/22, 5:01 PM - +234 903 224 4825: Because some Senators just did drama for us and that's serious. Yinmu. Drama lawon people yen se.
7/27/22, 5:02 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): You think if they go ahead with the process it won’t get messy?
7/27/22, 5:02 PM - +234 903 224 4825: Tamper in what sense please? How? Honestly asking.
7/27/22, 5:02 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): We know it’s drama 

Further drama is a stain on the administration
7/27/22, 5:02 PM - +234 903 224 4825: They can't. That's just it.
7/27/22, 5:02 PM - +234 903 224 4825: Aimoye stain. See JIMCRUZ 😂
7/27/22, 5:03 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): We saw how lawmakers were jumping fences and doing all sorts 

It’s a stain on the leadership of the house
7/27/22, 5:03 PM - +234 903 224 4825: Na today senators have been saying the President should resign?
7/27/22, 5:03 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Oga, not everyone is cool with controversies like that
7/27/22, 5:03 PM - +234 810 918 7203: 😂😂😂😂😂
7/27/22, 5:03 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Election is few months away 

There will be supports from outside
7/27/22, 5:03 PM - +234 903 224 4825: Yes. Leadership of the house. Se Dr Jonathan o wa je breakfast abi lo se FEC meeting ni week yen?
7/27/22, 5:04 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): NLC is having a nationwide protest 

You think the process can’t be fueled to at least escalate to public brews to further discredit APC?
7/27/22, 5:04 PM - +234 903 224 4825: Something wey no move Dr Jonathan will move Pres Buhari? Soldier mani?
7/27/22, 5:04 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I did not say the impeachment will happen
7/27/22, 5:05 PM - +234 903 224 4825: Well, true.
7/27/22, 5:05 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I’m referring to the leadership of the house not the President
7/27/22, 5:05 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Lawmakers fighting and disrupting session is not something everyone is cool with as a leader
7/27/22, 5:05 PM - +234 903 224 4825: That's correct.
7/27/22, 5:06 PM - +234 903 224 4825: So, if Dr Lawan intentionally bring forward their recess because of the schemes at the Senate, it could be a "smart move".
7/27/22, 5:06 PM - +234 903 224 4825: And they can even terminate that recess anytime. Saying for emergency kinikan kinikan.
7/27/22, 5:07 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Of course
7/27/22, 5:08 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Never forget that some members despite being APC will be emotionally moved if the matter should escalate beyond what it is.....

Not all members dey cool with everything that's happening
7/27/22, 5:09 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I tell you say if it’s fueled from outside, controversies  will emerge
7/27/22, 5:11 PM - +234 903 224 4825: They'll not finish impeachment process till the end of the administrative. The ideal/constitutional process to impeach a President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria takes not less than 9 months as explained by a lawyer sometimes back. 

That's of anyone gets "emotional" about impeaching the President.
7/27/22, 5:12 PM - +234 903 224 4825: *the administration
7/27/22, 5:15 PM - +234 903 224 4825: It has been since ayebaye that foreign agents and eyes dey Africa Governments. 

Voice of America was the first broke the news of Gen Sani Abacha's death. 

Foreign agents and interests have been fueling insecurity in Nigeria, Lake Chad basin, etc. 

So, it behoves on how smart the government is to address such move when it looms.
7/27/22, 5:16 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Of course but the image in the public is the issue

7/27/22, 6:41 PM - +234 906 762 1398: Yesterday I posted a picture of myself at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, undergoing a course.  That post was not sensitive to the present feelings of fellow citizens, especially parents and students who are presently bearing the brunt of the ongoing closure of public universities owing to the unresolved issues between the Academic Staff Union of Universities and the Federal Government of Nigeria.

I apologize for the post at this time, and I hope you will understand that it was not my intention to cause disaffection.

As Speaker of the House of Representatives, I have made multiple interventions within the powers of the legislature to avert the ongoing strike.  I had direct engagements with the leadership of ASUU and relevant government agencies. The House of Representatives is still keenly involved in seeking a resolution to the issues so our students can return to school. We all await the outcome of the 2-week ultimatum given for the conclusion of negotiations with ASUU. 

I have long been a champion of public education in Nigeria, and I have consistently advocated programs, policies and investments to improve the quality of public education in the country.  In my constituency and beyond, I have attracted a new international students hostel in UNILAG, access to internet WiFi in ALL public tertiary institutions in Lagos State; provision of modern ICT centres in 24 secondary schools across the state, provision of scholarships and grants to indigent students in selected tertiary institutions, provision of laptops to ALL secondary school teachers in my constituency and hundreds of students, facilitated the renovation of over 15 public schools in Lagos, facilitated the ongoing construction of the Open University Campus and JAMB CBT Centre in my constituency, facilitated the ongoing construction of School Auditoriums in both Lagos State University and School of Legal Studies, Katsina; facilitated the construction of a public library in Ondo; facilitated the ongoing construction of an emergency care centre for the University of Lagos Teaching Hospital amongst other numerous interventions. 

In keeping with my passion for education,  I regularly take time to teach in some public secondary schools across the country. 

I will continue to work within the remit of the legislature to provide our young people with access to quality education.

7/28/22, 12:48 PM - +234 906 762 1398: Resignation of APC Party Membership

Gentlemen of the Press, thank you for honoring our invitation at short notice.

Today, I hereby resign the membership of the All Progressive Congress (APC) after eleven (11) years of active partisanship in the party. While my deportment, in August 2011 to ACN and APC (now) was by fate, I remain mortally grateful to Aregbesola for that singular act. I had used the opportunity to serve my state diligently and with the whole of my heart. As a top management staff of the current biggest bank in Nigeria, I had used my contacts in the industry to raise funds to modernize my state. The sheer quantum of funds mobilized is a testament for creative financing and talent imbued by God on Osun citizens, who supported us during the capital raising. This couldn’t have been made possible, if assets were not created such as Omoluabi Conservation Fund, Recapitalization of Omoluabi Savings & Loan, etc to serve as buffer and sweeteners for the infrastructure financing. Unfortunate, many of these assets have been sold by subsequent administration. Also, the increase in Internally Generated Revenue, also served as a shot in the arm to enhance capacity and sustainability of debt finance.  Today, Osun is now in the league of state with modernized capital at Osogbo and with internally Generated Revenue of about 20billion naira annually. I had also used my relationship with the Governor of Central Bank (my former boss) to facilitate a 2b naira revolving fund for micro, small and medium farmers, traders and artisan without issuing an ISPO, for any monthly deduction from FAAC, a feat that had never been achieved before, by any state. 

At the local level, I had used the opportunities to serve the people of Oriade and Obokun Federal constituency facilitating many developmental projects to the towns and communities. At personal level, I had used my Foundation, created in 2007, to alleviate poverty and to support the widows and orphans. I have had to also learn the rudiments of “politicking” at grassroots and twice I chaired the federal constituency Campaign Committee of APC, touring all the nooks and crannies of my constituency, while working hard with many others at state level to sustain the winning streaks of 2014 and 2015, for APC in my federal constituency. In the 2014 election, 9 wards out of 12 wards were won by APC, unlike 2007, when only 3 wards were won by AC (legacy party of APC) in Oriade Local Government (my local government). I remain grateful to our stalwarts, followers and our people.

During the eleven (11) year period, I have had to assess the APC party against my expectations of the political ethos of our, Avatar, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, who would ever remain my political hero. His free education program of 1979, his biographies, his autobiography and stories from my father, a previous zikist, who left Zik movement to join Awolowo in Ibadan in the early fifty’s, have made me to fall in love with welfarism and progressivism. My expectation from Utilitarian view is that the most ethical choice, no matter how difficult it is, should be the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number, and I can say to a large extent, this had been met in Osun despite the meagre revenues, under the administration that I served (between 2011 and 2014). Unfortunately, this can not be said to have been met by many other APC-led states with humongous revenues. Likewise, the recent reckless abandonment of the developmental projects by the Administration that succeeded Aregbesola, the outgoing APC administration in Osun lends credence to the doubt, some people have on the sincerity of the progressive tendency. 

I had thought a consensus had been reached on what we needed to do in Osun by the topmost leadership of our party (including our national leader) before my engagement in 2011. I was interviewed twice for the job of commissioner of finance, Osun and in Ashiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s house at Ikoyi Lagos. The summary of my presentation and performance during the interviews were made available to Ashiwaju, Rauf Aregbesola and myself by Sam Omatseye (a very senior editor of The Nation newspaper, who conducted the second interview). I was given a clean bill on the professed ideologies, congruence of goals and understanding of the vision of the party. After completing the first term, around December 2014, Aregbesola took me to Tinubu again for review of Osun Finance and to chart a way forward, another clean bill was issued by Ashiwaju himself and the financial options were agreed upon to navigate the economic headwind occasioned by the significant drop in the price of crude oil, while we were in the midst of leverage finance of infrastructures. That someone would deny this catalogue of events is unthinkable and a lesson in “followership”.  Yes, leaders pick their team/followers, followers should also pick their leaders.

I resumed my job in August, 2011 to inherit a portfolio, previously managed by some “characters”, who had been in Aregbesola’s administration for the previous eight(8) months and who had their own preferred candidate in mind. When we were interviewed, it was glaring to the panel of Wale Edun, Sola Adeeyo and Rauf Aregbesola that I was a better choice, though I didn’t sound desperate. The die was cast in many instances. An omnibus internal approval was in place for capital market (bond issuance) offering of 50billion Naira. Also, a 25billion naira medium term facility from First Bank Plc was on the table and one-third already drawn. As much as I didn’t like the structure of the First Bank loan, I had no choice than to “thinker” with it only. A booby trap of some kind by these “characters”, if I had allowed moratorium to end and for repayment to commence, the cashflow would suffer and I would have been facing a moving train with a Governor, whose appetite for developmental projects was huge and who needed cash badly. 

Then, Governor Aregbesola wanted to please the masses through empowerment, good infrastructures. He wanted to satisfy workers and correct the political baggage of his party, notorious, previously, for not being labour friendly. Governor Aregbesola wanted to do stakeholders patronage to rally his political base. No doubt, I had my job well cut out for me. With excruciating pains, I had to learn how to work and manage these “characters”. Honestly, you dare not manage them, even Governor Aregbesola, himself had had to beg them severally, in my presence, to get things done. They never nudge Governor Aregbesola that he was doing too much. That he doesn’t listen? No. They should tell it to the marine because they could escalate it to the national leadership, who he had almost a servitude relationship with. They were better placed with the national leadership than Aregbesola, and they were using that advantage to their personal benefits, anyway. I  knew it wouldn’t last too long but I made up my mind not to leave Governor Aregbesola, until he won his re-election bid because his first win was through court process.

I worked with many other party leaders and men to ensure 2014 victory for the APC. Twice, I survived guns pointed at my head, one in Delta and one in my federal constituency. The election was won despite the federal mights used against us. I thought I was done with public life. Subsequently, and after the 2014 election, at the instance of Ashiwaju, who prompted Jim Ovia to still prevail on me to stay back, I worked as the personal assistant on finance (a pro bono service to Aregbesola) to restructure the loan portfolio and to process the Paris Club Refund among other refunds (some are still outstanding). Once, the Paris club refund (the windfall) was approved in December 2016, the music changed again and for my dear life, I have to move on with my life. The rest is history! It will be interesting to ask, who administered that Paris club refund with Aregbesola?

That the same characters, who excluded me from the Labour-Government Committee in June 2015 by convincing Aregbesola that I was too sympathetic to labour, to now turn the salary issue and salary apportionment, (which they recommended) to an albatross for Ogbeni is unbelievable. When, it was their turn, we saw how they treated labour. No wonder, the Bible says the heart of a man is wicked and desperately so, who can foretell it. I have resisted the emissary sent to me, to look the other way, when they stripped off Aregbesola and continued to defame him on projects and programs that they were jointly and severally responsible for. I among very few others, resisted them and my resistance was based on moral value and disposition that truth must always prevail over fiction. After the 2022 Gubernatorial election, the recent vituperations and venoms, including spells, coming out of the party men, (who worked with the current Governor) have exposed the underbelly of the party in Osun and what to come.

While I remain truthful to my values, it’s like the APC party at the Osun state level has gone beyond salvage with deceit, injustice, lack of fairness, unhealthy/needless rivalry and poor reward system that are aliens to what Awolowo stood for. There is a mortal departure from the old time progressive ideologies culminating in a loss of election by the incumbent APC governor, who was the Governor- in-waiting, during the eight year of the Administration of Aregbesola. My people in Oriade and Obokun Federal Constituemcy, the old time beacon of Awolowo’s progressivism in ijesa land have responded in the last governorship election through their votes in the two local governments and seriously, by their about fifty-five thousand (55,000) votes. I need no other proof of the clarion call of my people to align with their aspiration without changing my values, which I hold sacrosanct. The progress of the 2014 election had been reversed in my local government (Oriade) with APC loosing 9 wards out of 12 wards; exact opposite of what we had, when we started retrieving the popularity of APC Oriade in 2011, from PDP. Such is he fate of the APC party in many other local governments in Osun, now.

All politics is local and It is normal in any political clime that when, a councillor, the junior most government functionary leaves his position, he will have a saying in his ward (as part of the ward leadership caucus) on, who becomes next councillor and ward party executive. In APC, Osun, it was a complete aberration; as a former commissioner in a ward, who is yet to produce another, subsequent  state officer, I don’t have a saying in the party exco at ward and LG levels?. Who does that? Likewise many party stalwarts. They took the party to the valley of shadow of shame, but some of us decided to fly to the TOP. Yes, they made bones and may God bless their little souls. The only option, is to disown the man, who led us to the party (in the first instance) and to join their Lordship, within the same party. This is morally bankrupt and “conscienceless” for me.

Having served at the highest statutory level of the state, as the former comissioner of finance, it is no longer my wish to offer myself for state cabinet position in any administration of the state, so let no one make a mistake or an insinuation about my current compulsion to resign my membership of APC and to join the People Democratic Party (PDP). I have been in APC for eight years (after I left office) without any patronage, benefits  or appointment, yet I worked for the party in the 2015 and 2019 federal election. I can survive outside government and very well too. My records are there in Zenith Bank, where I pioneered different financing  groups (upstream oil and gas, Telecom, power sector, infrastructure group) at different times, when God allowed me to conquer one front after the other. My Adrenalin is usually fired by the new challenge. I have consulted wisely and widely with my followers, admirers, friends and families, who felt we should pitch our tent with PDP, to join this party and to work with them to shine the light (Imole Osun). We would have done this before the 2022 Gubernatorial election, but knowing “them” it was better “to err on the side of caution”, for us to have Today, Tomorrow and future.

Thank you very much.

This Segbowe guy, I love him. As a matter of fact, I'm falling in love with him. 

I think he intentionally leave out the fact that Tobi Amusan didn't later graduate from TASUED and mentioned the university twice, I think that's intentional, too. Strategic selling the name of the university and theirs. That's so lovely. He's a patriot.

7/28/22, 4:15 PM - +234 903 224 4825: The BBC in Nigeria - Between Reporting and Propagating Terror  By Kadaria Ahmed 
  
It has simply gotten out of hand.  
Journalists and now a global media organisation of repute,the BBC, which should know better, are becoming a tool for terrorists, even if unwittingly, by amplifying the faces, voices and stories of killers and marauders who are still operating with impunity across Nigeria. 

The public interest argument seems to have been misunderstood, some may even say misrepresented, to enable sensationalist reporting that is very unlikely to be allowed on screens in the United Kingdom.  By not upholding the same standards as they would uphold in the UK, in their work in Nigeria, the BBC Africa Eye producers in their latest documentary titled ‘The Bandits Warlords of Zamfara’  have provided a global platform to terrorists and can be accused of becoming an accomplice to terror in the name of reporting it.  

When Communications Professor at the University of Toronto Mahmoud Eid coined the term Terroredia, in his book Exchanging Terrorism Oxygen for Media Airwaves, Eid argues that there is now a ‘relationship between terrorists and media professionals in which acts of terrorism and media coverage are exchanged, influenced, and fuelled by one another.’ Since it was written 7 years ago, it would appear the case Eid was trying to make is now quite self-evident, especially in Nigeria where increasingly, propaganda videos and statements by terror groups as well as features on terror leaders are finding their way into mainstream media. We can  now easily identify, for example, the faces of the major kingpins responsible for the widespread kidnappings and killings that are occurring on a daily basis in the Northern part of Nigeria, no thanks to having their pictures and videos splashed all over the pages of newspapers and on our television screens almost as if they are Nollywood A-listers. 

None of this has ‘helped’ our inept government, led by President Muhamadu Buhari, to find and arrest these blood-thirsty criminals.  The ‘pressure’ has also not stopped the administration from playing ostrich and finding an effective way of tackling insecurity. These are some of the public interest arguments put forward by those defending the featuring of predatory criminals on national and now international media platforms. 

The arguments also include an assertion that hearing from terrorists helps us better understand the conflicts and therefore come up with solutions. Under the guise of public interest, this is the argument that BBC Africa Eye seems to be presenting, to justify its decision to actively give copious screen time to self-confessed murderers and kidnappers, who are still actively involved in attacking communities, killing, kidnapping, pillaging and generally making life brutish and a living hell for the people of Nigeria’s North-western State of Zamfara and beyond. 

The two promotional clips released for  the documentary, the Bandits Warlords of Zamfara , feature a marauder who should remain nameless here, confirming that he was part of those who raided Jengebe girls’ secondary school in the state, abducting over 300 students with the attendant horror of these sorts of crimes normally entail, and releasing them, after the payment of ransom. Evidently, the BBC Africa Eye team also had no problem utilising footage  that appears to have been shot by these self-confessed criminals because this makes it into the second trailer. No media of repute would take this decision because it is generally understood that these sorts of videos are recorded by terrorists for one thing and one thing only: propaganda.   

Reports of the documentary in national newspapers also quote one of the featured criminals boasting, in the documentary, that he only kills, and doesn't kidnap for ransom. This is the nature of the program that the ‘reputable’ BBC Africa Eye is positioning as having a public interest imperative. 

To be clear, the current state of insecurity and all that it entails is the fault of the Federal Government, led by President Muhammadu Buhari, and he must be held responsible for the carnage and state of anarchy engulfing the nation. That does not however mean irresponsible reporting by the media, which after all should champion the common man, should not be challenged.  

If terrorists were killing and kidnapping British citizens, especially young children, the BBC would not enable interviews by the perpetrators, particularly if they were still roaming footloose and fancy-free, without an iota of remorse for their crimes and also carrying out many more. The trauma to the psyche of the British public will be unbearable, and the BBC would not be willing to pay that price, or risk the legal consequences sure to ensue.  

In the era of the Irish Republican Army, the IRA, for example, the group didn't make it onto the airwaves of the BBC. Indeed, reporting of the activities of the political party seen as the political arm of the IRA, Sein Fein, was heavily censored. Every time they spoke, the BBC deleted their voices and replaced them with those of actors, in obedience to British Government directives which were put in place because the authorities believed publicity is like air for ‘terrorists’ groups, helping them to grow and thrive. And even though Sein Fein shared what many might argue is only an ideological position with the IRA, they were denied a presence on British airwaves in substantial ways.  

Here in Nigeria, concerns about the impact the amplification of terrorists' voices will have both on victims, their families and the public appear to be a secondary consideration to the BBC’s insistence on hearing from the bandits' first-hand accounts and justification for their murderous activities.  

There is no good argument that can justify  the damage this is doing to the public that  includes  the school girls in Jangebe, who can now in perpetuity, watch the story of their abductions from the mouth of their abductors and relive the attendant trauma of that horrible crime.  
For all of these school girls, victims and their families, the BBC Africa Eye has confirmed their attackers' invincibility. By documenting and handing over on a platter of gold one of the most respected media brands in the world to justify their actions, the BBC has iconised violent men leading marauding militias that are killing, abducting, maiming and leaving terror in their wake across large sways of Nigeria and who are clearly neither sorry for their crime nor looking to stop anytime soon.  

It is hard to see how this will not contribute to deepening fear, mistrust, hopelessness and damage to the national psyche while undoubtedly helping with recruitment, all ingredients that actively contribute to successful outcomes for terror groups. 

The public's right to know is a sacrosanct tenant of journalists who are not and should not be in the job of censoring news. Finding the balance between that and ensuring media platforms do not provide the oxygen of publicity for terrorists and criminals is not easy, but it is at these difficult junctures that good journalism needs to stand its ground.  

Recognising the importance of getting it right globally, experts including those at the BBC have taken the trouble to develop guidelines for reporting difficult stories including stories of conflict and terrorism.  The German Press Code for example says “in reporting actual and threatened acts of violence, the Press should carefully weigh the public’s interest in information against the interest of victims and other people involved. It should report on such incidents in an independent and authentic way, but not allow itself to be made the tool of criminals. Nor should it undertake independent attempts to mediate between criminals and the police. THERE MUST BE NO INTERVIEWS WITH PERPETRATORS DURING ACTS OF VIOLENCE.’’ 

The German guidelines are unequivocal about not giving airtime to criminals involved in ongoing criminal activities and for very good reason. The BBC’s editorial guidelines are more watery, perhaps explaining why the BBC Africa Eye team is able to be cavalier about such a critical issue. But even these guidelines say “any proposal to approach an organisation (or an individual member of an organisation) designated a ‘terrorist group’ by the Home Secretary under the Terrorism Acts, and any proposal to approach individuals or organisations responsible for acts of terror, to participate in our output must be referred in advance to Director Editorial Policy and Standard and also any proposal to broadcast content made by perpetrators of a hijacking, kidnapping, hostage-taking or siege must be referred to a senior editorial figure.’’  The questions to answer therefore include: did senior people in London at the BBC fully understood that they were authorizing the recording of terrorists who are still active and who between them have been responsible for the abduction, rape and killings of thousands of people including school children?   

There are other questions.  

When homeland terrorists committed the inconceivable crime of hacking British soldier Lee Rigby to death in May 2013, would the BBC have considered it in the public interest to interview these terrorists? To compare apples with apples, imagine that hero Rigby's murderers were never held for their crimes, continued butchering people and collecting seven figure ransoms., would the BBC dare to send reporters to film the murderers gloating about collecting ransom, and then hold Twitter Spaces and bask in views, clicks and likes? 
The answer is NO. The BBC would never dare.  

Why then is the BBC okay to fund, then publicise the glorification of practicing murderers still butchering hundreds across Nigeria and the Chad Basin? How did this three-year disregard for African lives come about, and why is this acceptable? 

By their own admission, the BBC Africa Eye producers claim their reporting occurred over three-years. This is clearly well before the crime against the school girls in Jangebe occurred. These bandits and their factions commit cross-border crimes. Therefore, as a matter of urgent national and regional security, other questions which the BBC must answer publicly, in the actual interest of the public include: 
1. In all these years it was conducting these ‘investigations’ of terrorists, did the BBC harbour information on potential criminal or or actual crimes they happened an did the BBC withhold this information from the relevant African security authorities?  
2. After the particular interviews in which the murderers admit their collection of ransoms, and committing acts of kidnap, did the BBC hand over any of this footage to the authorities, and do so in a timely manner? 
3. What footage and information has the BBC handed over to law enforcement, since the publication of this documentary?  

In covering a subset of criminals for three years, the BBC has brazenly admitted that it was shooting criminals before, during and after the commission of dastardly crimes that have destroyed generations present and unborn.     

The BBC Africa Eye documentaries series have been designed specifically for release on social media platforms (Facebook and YouTube). Given the programme's track record of dubious editorial decisions and accusations of unethical behaviour including by local reporters who worked with them, BBC managers in London should also explain if the decision to put this documentary out on social media was designed to ensure its producers are not held to the high global broadcast standards the BBC is known for and which are applicable to content broadcast within the UK?  

When BBC Africa Eye did a story on drug addiction in Nigeria, there were attempts by a producer to sensationalize some of the reporting, to make it more gripping. On that occasion, he was working with a seasoned and brave journalist who pushed back. When they did a story on Sex for Grades, the two reporters responsible for the story ended up trading blame on social media over sex for by-line allegations. Again, the producers didn't come out smelling of roses. An investigative report by them on a popular talk show host in Nigeria who is revered by millions saw the journalist who did that reporting flee his home together with his family as a result of threats to his life. The BBC failed in its duty of care to this local journalist and in the end fellow journalists had to rally around to provide him with safe spaces. 

In all, the team at BBC Africa Eye appear to be striving to do reporting that would be unacceptable in the UK for being unethical and transparently against public interest. The problem is they have capitalised on the justified anger of the people and the inconceivable failure of the government, to once again resurrect the ugliest vestiges of colonialism, which one had hoped were long buried.  

The unfolding anarchy and violence in Nigeria are serious matters, and every attempt must be made to keep the public informed. A documentary that investigates and examines government failures while centring victims and their families would have done that. Giving boastful, bloodthirsty criminals a global platform serves only two purposes. It provides free publicity for terror and enables the BBC to push viewership figures on social media. 

It does nothing for public service. Even if it does not realise it, the BBC’s reputation for stellar public service journalism is being damaged. 

Black lives, their humanity and national security, should matter more than clicks. 

Hopefully someone in London will take note.

7/28/22, 7:33 PM - +234 814 235 8262: If you watch the BBC Africa eye story about the Bandit war lord of Zamfara, you will understand why Insecurity in Nigeria  is not ending soon. Unless the Government takes human Development important, especially Policies that will change the Basic thinking of a Fulani child 👶 because this people who are born in a zone of war, Gun shot And violence, How do we expect something good to come from them. The Legislative arm should give special consideration to that part of the country and race the bar of Western Education. Without this, insecurity will continue to be the business of the day. They believe Government earn when there’s insecurity in the state, while they also earn.  It’s now a business venture and a means to disgrace Government. it’s a win win for them.

Just like Cyber crime is the other day in the southern part of the country, banditry will continue to reign in North west. 
BBC Africa is exposing Federal Government inaction, and Buhari administration is insensitive to it.

My fear is that, everything happening recently will keep diminishing the chances of ASIWAJU come next election 😌

Bro, u dey use emotions talk n I understand.

How many people don go police station lay complaints of the happenings.

When u say multiple reports online, police would not act on such information unless when necessary.

Sometimes we need to know how most of this things work. If not we go dey LULE ni

7/30/22, 8:26 AM - +234 817 014 8364: Have u reported a missing person case before😂.

Police will tell u to go home and if d person is not back within the stipulated law time, they would not work on it.

Due to this, many have been maimed or killed before they act

BBC’s Disparagement Of Tobi Amusan’s World Record

By Ahmed Sule 

On July 24, Nigeria’s Tobi Amusan smashed the 100m women’s hurdles world record in the semi-final of the World Athletics Championship in Oregon, USA. She dominated a field that included America’s former record holder Kendra Harrison. Amusan had barely crossed the finishing line when the BBC crew comprising of Andrew Cotter, Michael Johnson, and Steve Cram began casting doubt on the timing of her record-breaking world performance. Andrew Cotter said, “She has smashed the world record; she has really won 12.12 seconds, taken almost a tenth of a second.” Michael Johnson added, “You don’t beat Kendra Harrison by such a margin.” Cotter continued, “We are trying to process this, but 12.12 seconds?”

Britain’s Cindy Sember and Japan’s Mako Fukube, who came fourth and eighth respectively in the race, posted national records. In response to the fast times, Cotter said, “Something is going on; we hope those times in the first heat are correct. Everyone was running extraordinary fast in the first heat.” He said, “We should highlight how quick the time has been and hope that the timing is accurate.”

Michael Johnson dismissively said, “I am not believing these times.” Cotter then asked Colin Jackson, the former 110 m World Champion, what he thought about the race and Jackson replied, “It would be interesting that the IAAF would have to ratify the record and check it quite intensely.” Cotter said, “You want to believe this, but 12.12.” Steve Cram remarked, “I noticed her reaction time was 0.144 and if you are shaving record, you have to have a super-fast reaction time.” Michael Johnson said, “In order to break a record you have to put everything. The margin is so big so the reaction time, leaning has to happen before you break the record.” Cotter then said, “Cindy Sember has qualified for the final. At least it is fair. If the timing is off, it is off for everyone.” At the commencement of the final, Cotter said, “Whether the timing is right or not and that will all be subject to be ratification, we have the right athletes. Tobi Amusan was much quicker, whether that world record is ratified or not.”

At the BBC studio, the pundits stated that Tobi Amusan would have to back up her world-recording-breaking feat, but it would be challenging for her as all eyes would be on her. In the final race, Tobi Amusan eventually silenced her BBC critics by winning the final in 12.06 seconds.

The BBC’s response to Amusan’s feat contrasts sharply with how the broadcaster responded to the other two world records broken during the championship. When America’s Sydney McLaughlin crossed the finishing line in 50.68 seconds to break the women’s 400 m hurdles world record, nobody in the BBC commentating team questioned the authenticity of the timing. Instead, as she approached the finishing line, Andrew Cotter screamed, “Watch the clock!” And after she won, “She smashes the world record. Incredible, 50.68 seconds.”
Cotter continued, “Unbelievable; she is unbeatable, but that is a time; she would have got through the initial rounds of 400 m flat jumping hurdles; she transcends the sports.” Michael Johnson remarked, “I am so excited about it …50.68 is a great time for a flat 400 m runner …she has the ability to hurdle well, so she is not off balance; that is why the time is so fast; she has great speed and endurance.”

Similarly, when Armand “Mondo” Duplantis scaled the 6.21 m hurdle to break the pole vault world record, there wasn’t a single moment of doubt from the BBC commentators. Instead, the event commentator shouted, “The flying Swede does it again. More magic from Mondo. This man was born to pole vault; produces the highest pole ever seen. Incredible, extraordinary… Look how high it is"

Malcolm X once said, “Of all our studies, history is best qualified to reward our research.” One must look into the history book to understand BBC’s shameful and unprofessional attitude towards Tobi Amusan. The BBC Empire Service was formed in 1932 and served as the propaganda arm of the British Empire. 

Although BBC Empire Service has now been renamed BBC World Service, BBC is yet to shake off the shackles of its colonial mind-set.

When one watches BBC during sporting competitions like the Olympics and World Athletics Championship, one could get the impression that it is diverse, especially when one sees the likes of Colin Jackson, Denise Lewis, Michael Johnson, and Jeanette Kwayke. However, the presence of these black faces does not erase the fact that BBC, including its sporting unit, is a neo-colonial enterprise. During the championship, in addition to the three world records, nine championship records were broken. However, BBC questioned none of the records. So why the uproar about Tobi Amusan’s record? Amusan’s victory was against the expectation of the BBC commentators as she was
competing for Nigeria in an event not dominated by West Africans. Her performance did not fit the usual narrative of East Africans dominating the middle distances and Americans and Jamaicans dominating the sprint. In short, instead of “staying in her lane” by being a fringe participant, she had the nerve to dominate and smash the world record and make an American look ordinary.

The commentators could not hide their western arrogance irrespective of their colour. Andrew Cotter’s joy when Cindy Sember qualified is a classic manifestation of this arrogance. If Tobi Amusan had followed the path of other sportsmen and women of Nigerian heritage such as Anthony Joshua, Bukayo Saka, Christine Ohuruogu, and Daley Thompson in competing for Great Britain, the probability of Johnson and Cotter questioning the world record would have been almost zero.

BBC athletic commentators set invisible boundaries for who they expect to excel in certain events. But when outsiders from these regions dominate against their expectations, they often raise their colonial eyebrows. For instance, when South Africa’s Caster Semenya began to dominate the 800 m at the London and Rio Olympics, BBC’s Paula Radcliffe embarked on a personal crusade to dehumanise her. So when you see the likes of Michael Johnson cast aspersion on Amusan’s timing, one should not be surprised — he is just manifesting what could be described as Anglo-American exceptionalism in black face.

BBC’s ugly reaction to Tobi Amusan’s performance should serve as a wake-up call to many middle-class Africans who often see western news channels like the BBC and CNN as arbiters of truth. It is time to see them for what they are: neo-colonial propaganda tools for western hegemony.

7/31/22, 9:44 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): SPEECH DELIVERED BY RT HON YAKUBU DOGARA, GUEST SPEAKER AT THE APC NORTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERS SUMMIT, ABUJA 2022 ON THE THEME, “RIGHTEOUSNESS EXALTS A NATION, BUT SIN IS A REPROACH TO ANY PEOPLE”, HELD ON FRIDAY 29TH JULY, 2022 AT THE NICON LUXURY HOTEL, ABUJA

Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people. Proverbs 14:34

Protocols:

1. I consider it great honour and privilege to be invited as the Guest Speaker at this all-important August summit of eminent religious leaders and top-notch politicians from across all the States of the Federation. Permit me to start by profusely thanking all those involved in putting together this summit and all the delegates who have sacrificed time and their busy schedule in order to honour us with their presence, which we do not lightly esteem. I understand we are here to talk about our nation and how political choices may impact our faith and likely exacerbate the escalating parlous security situation and stymie our match towards an inclusive, peaceful and prosperous nation. 

2. Not a few have expressed concerns about national outlook on all presidential tickets. Also, not a few worry that the debate was becoming corrosive, and of course, with this kind of spitting of bilious views into the political wind, there was bound to be lots of nerves in the air. 

3. When we talk about a Muslim-Muslim ticket; God forbid that we should be understood to be objecting to Muslims or that we don’t want Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to be president. It is not about Senator Kashim Shettima either, but it about what is right and what is wrong. It is about justice, fairness and equity. It is about Nigeria; it’s diversity and how it can be harnessed in an inclusive manner for the greater good of all of us. Be that as it may, some of us really wanted Asiwaju to be president because he has sacrificed much for our Party, the APC and for what he represents to so many people. So, our position cannot be against Muslims or Islam. That fact cannot be denied in any way. 

4. But when it comes to choosing between the love and admiration I have for an individual and what is right and what I believe represents my vision for Nigeria, my choice will clearly be for the latter. After all, my rise to the position of Speaker was never going to be possible without the support of some Muslim members who believe that our diversity must be reflected in national positions for the unity, peace and advancement of our dear country. What gives me more hope about the Nigeria project is that there are many of our Muslim brothers and leaders who did not only warn the APC, but have had to call out the APC for adopting a Muslim-Muslim ticket which resulted into the Party ructions we are witnessing today. 

5. In 2015, when we were called “janjeweed party”, my response was usually very simple. I could then say that, HE John Oyegun was the chairman of my party and my Vice-Presidential candidate was Pastor Yemi Osinbajo. We don’t enjoy that luxury anymore as the President, Senate President, Speaker and his deputy; Senate and House Leaders; National Chairman and the Deputy National Chairman; Presidential and the Vice-Presidential candidates are all Muslims, leaving the Christians with just the position of VP Osibanjo and Deputy Senate President Omo-Agege at that level in a Country whose population is fairly split between Muslims and Christians. Granted this scenario, can any God-fearing Muslim, Christian nay even the amoral and the atheist say this is fair, just and righteous? Does this represent the act of a just God? This is the real context of objections from the Christian community not just the Presidential ticket and the VP slot. 

6. For me, it is a rude awakening and I am so happy it happened sooner than later. The very fact that they said we should not worry about a Muslim-Muslim ticket while a Muslim-Christian ticket gave them sleepless nights should make you worry the more. To worry about a Muslim-Christian ticket while counselling others not to worry about a Muslim-Muslim ticket is the very textbook definition of cognitive dissonance and an attempt at gaslighting gullible Christians. Truth must be told that anyone who is not bringing us together is consciously tearing us apart.

7. Furthermore, I do not want to speak to the argument that there is no Christian competent enough to be Vice-President because as we all know, that is hogwash. It only speaks to the need to deliberately exclude - whereas the need now is for inclusion. 

8. The other funny argument in the media is the claim that without a northern Muslim on the ticket, elections cannot be won. The implications of that argument are quite unambiguous; Northern Muslims don’t vote for the South - even if the candidate is a Muslim like them - and, of course, don’t vote for Christians. However, nothing can be further from the truth. If you stretch this argument further, it may lead to questions such as, “if Muslims in the North don’t trust a southern Muslim for any reason(s), why should Christians in Nigeria trust a Muslim from the South and North?” These are the kinds of arguments I hate to engage in and which we must avoid if we hope not to injure the health of our Republic.

9. Other unhelpful framings of the debate by the so-called pundits posits that Christians in the North are so small in number that their votes don’t count. This strange argument seeks to reinforce the satanic agenda of dividing the church in Nigeria into North and South, and also ignores the fact and reality that Nigeria is evenly split on religious lines. These pundits are still not smart enough to tell us what is in the Muslim-Muslim ticket for southern Christians. The argument also ignores the fact that our official policy excludes religious affiliation from census data. There is therefore no scientific basis for these bizarre conclusions. Let us now look at a model for managing diversity. 

10. If the UK offers any example, in 2005, the Tories had only two non-White MPs. Just within over a decade, this has changed dramatically - all the way to the top ranks of the party, including the last three chancellors of the exchequer in a row: Javid, Sunak and Zahawi. In addition, Patel was home secretary; Javid - health secretary; Kwasi - business secretary and; Zahawi - education secretary.

11. Before the pruning down of candidates for the Conservative Party leadership to two; six of the candidates were members of ethnic minorities. Braverman, Sunak and Javid are the children of immigrants while Chisti and Zahawi were born outside of the UK: in Pakistan and Iraq respectively; and our own Kemi was partly brought up in Lagos. All these happened in the conservative UK where the entire population of minority ethnic group is a paltry 14% - thanks to David Cameron under whose leadership the Tories embraced the idea of “sponsored mobility” which was thought to be good for the country because it will help prevent politics from polarizing along racial lines.

12. As we speak, the UK may well be on the verge of becoming the second major Western democracy to have a non-White leader in Sunak. Sunak who took the oath of office as Chancellor with his hand on the Bhagavad Gita and placed Diwali candles on the steps of his office on Number 11 Downing Street, shares the same faith with just 1.03 million Britons representing just 1.6% of the U.K’s total population. This is how democracies all over the world are managing diversities within their borders. Compare this to the US under Trump where the Republican Party was and is still in danger of becoming the party of White grievances and White reaction against an increasingly diverse America. Is it in vain that the Democrats had to settle for a woman and a black VP in Kamala Harris? Women issues are treated as minority issues and what percentage of US population is black? Just 13.4% in case you don’t know. In these two, we have two models to borrow from; either to play the politics of exclusion which the Muslim-Muslim ticket represents or to make politics all-inclusive in order to heal our national fault lines and unite our disparate peoples for nation building. The latter must be the choice of every patriotic and sensible Nigerian.

13. Why do I consider the decision by the APC to settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket not a bold but bad decision? There are ample reasons but I will highlight a few for want of time and space.

a) It is a bad decision because it fuels inequality. We must always bear in mind that the liberty we enjoy is as rare as it is fragile. Inequality has a way of upsetting the balance due to the universal law of cause and effect. Throughout history, every revolution has been waged to either consolidate or destroy inequality. Just like all revolutions, they first seem impossible and then improbable until they become inevitable. 

i) When you think of revolutions, what comes to your mind? Is it the pictures of savage invasions, crushing battlefield defeats, sacked cities and unlucky rulers put to death or a cascading series of minor, individually unimportant failures which are now replete in our polity? You may not understand the structure of revolutions until you trace the progression of the Nazis from an unpopular fringe group to the most powerful political party in Germany. Those who are dismissive of those who built conflict generating structures such as the Muslim-Muslim ticket in a pluralistic society always end up as enablers of revolution or violent changes. That was how Nazism was dismissed as a fringe idea that will never make it into the mainstream of civilized Germany until it led to the death of an estimated 40 million people.

b) It is a bad decision because it breads division which is counter-productive to our collective aspirations for a united and prosperous nation. My last check reveals that the word division is a construct of the word “vision” with a prefix “di” which means double in Latin. Just imagine what double vision does to an individual, much more a Nation. Our national creed or motto if you like, is unity and faith, peace and progress. Embedded in this great idea is the fact that unity precedes peace and progress. The question therefore is, how do we unite our disparate peoples in a manner that ensures peace and progress? This is not the only question, it is every question.

i) Of course, our strength is not in numbers but unity. You are not strong because you are many, you are strong because you are united. Nigeria cannot survive if we merely tolerate each other or if the happiness of one group is the unhappiness of the other group. But if we are united, we will be indomitable. And if all of us: Muslims, Christians, atheists, the old, the young, women and men work together and pray together in unity: believe me; we will be invincible. On the corollary, many are the Nations and Empires that could not withstand divisions. 

ii) The largest construction project ever on earth - the erection of the Tower of Babel came to an abrupt halt due to divisions. The almost 3200 years long recorded history of the Egyptian empire collapsed due to divisions when Cleopatra the last Pharaoh killed her brother Ptolemy the 13th who was a joint heir to the throne and married another of her brother, Ptolemy the 14th before she had him also killed so that her son can succeed her as the pharaoh. The all-powerful Roman Empire just like the British Empire after it, decayed and died not on account of invading armies but just because they could not withstand the contradictions within. Need we say more about Yugoslavia and the USSR? 

iii) The US too is currently struggling and if they don’t invent ingenious ways to heal divisions, the US dominance, just like all the other empires before, might soon become history. If we think we can encourage divisions in the scale we are witnessing and not see what those Empires and Nations saw, then we are of all men and women most miserable. 

c) In addition, the inability to distinguish the Nigeria of 1993 from 2022 gave me cause to fret the more. An indispensable attribute of a leader in crisis is to be able to recognize a departure of events from routine to novel. The inability to spot an infliction point in moments of gripping visceral fear across the nation represents an irredeemable fatal error of judgment. There has never been a time in our history that we are as divided. We are battling terrorism, banditry, kidnapping for ransom, secessionists and all manner of challenges.

Consequently, anyone who thinks that events in Nigeria in 2022 are not novel but routine as they were in 1993 is totally incapable of finding solutions to challenges currently ravaging our dear nation. 

14. As for the nodding dogs who have sold themselves to lying spirits by deliberately believing in lies or are refusing to accept the truth, rebuke them in love. We may, after all, be dealing with fallen angels. We must never forget that every generation has its own Jannes and Jambres who withstood Moses; its prophets of Baal who withstood Elijah; its Sanballats and Tobiahs who withstood Nehemiah; it’s Esaus whose profanity will drive them to sell their birth rights; its Gehazis who will surrender to seducing spirits in order to feed their greed; its Hamans who will plot to annihilate Gods people: the list goes on. On this class of people, the scripture has already placed a curse, “Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!” Isaiah 5:20. But just as those they withstood overcame, we will also overcome if we faint not. 

15. The harder they try to make us bow to the golden image of greed, the more we should chant to their chagrin the answer given by Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego - who said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up”.

16. In closing, let me reiterate the fact that we are here to talk about what is right and what is wrong. To my mind what is right is not just to win elections but to unite Nigerians both now and after the elections so that we can collectively build a Nigeria that works for all regardless of creed. As President Obama warned, “if you have to win a campaign by dividing people, you are not going to be able to govern them. You won’t be able to unite them later” This is spot-on because anyone who wins an election by dividing us would have to keep us divided in order to govern us. This is not what any reasonable and peace-loving Nigerian wants. 

17. As long as God remains the God of justice, may we continue to resist injustice to our sinews, no matter who is for or against it because it is the requirement of the just God. Let us go out from this summit with the resolve to seek out our Muslim brothers and sisters who believe in unifying our people in order to usher in the much need peace and advancement for Nigeria to unleash her true potentials. I am sure we will jointly agree on a platform that would advance our collective search for unity, peace and development. Believe me, the only alternative is the road to Yugoslavia. God forbid! If we want to see Nigeria exalted, we must insist she does the right things.

8/4/22, 3:25 PM - Iseyemi: I talk say Why
8/4/22, 3:25 PM - +234 903 224 4825: The point is people stand inside mosque that they need help after prayer, and people donate. It's stealing when you take from fisebilillahi. Just like someone ask you to hold money for him and you took from it and the person didn't know. Stealing!
8/4/22, 3:25 PM - +234 816 463 6464: If he had asked, would they have given me the money....

Be sincere with your response
8/4/22, 3:25 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I can give my pastors money much more than 10% of my earning

8/4/22, 3:27 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Ewo 😂
8/4/22, 3:27 PM - +234 903 224 4825: If he has ask that he need the money for what? 

Are people just asking for help and they give to them in the mosque?

Yes, he could have been given. He doesn't have the right to demand from the fisebillilahi money, just say you need help, and people donate for you. 

Fisebillillah money is usually for many purposes, mosque maintenance, fueling of generator, etc. Many things sha.
8/4/22, 3:27 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Church wey I dey do like servant no ft even raise fund for me

8/4/22, 3:28 PM - +234 903 224 4825: In this case, sadaqah could even be higher than zakat. Is mostly higher. Because zakat must be measured and it's even higher rewarding.

8/4/22, 5:39 PM - +234 903 224 4825: IMPORTANT INFORMATION 

I wish to draw the attention of our youths in Oyo State and beyond on the upcoming capacity building training programmes in the Oil and Gas Industry. The training is only for those seeking jobs in the Oil and Gas industry.

There are two programme categories: One is for SSCE/OND holders (called vocational) while the other is for graduates (called professionals).

During the programme, you will be paid 100k monthly (vocational) or 150k monthly(professional). You will also be assisted with the cost of accomodation and travel (since the programme is likely to be domiciled in a Oil producing state).

The programme lasts between 1 and 2 years and it would be linked with a planned/future Oil and Gas project.

30% of those that successfully complete the programme are absorbed on to the project they were linked with and offered permanent jobs with Oil Companies (IOC). 

To benefit/participate, you need to register and submit your details/credentials at the following site:

https://nogicjqs.gov.ng/

NB: THE REGISTRATION IS FREE.

8/4/22, 11:33 PM - +234 813 948 8163: Dear Parents, 

If you're reading this, please take it easy on your adult children living with you.

Be kind with words towards them, be less judgemental and don't be too quick to shut them up or throw insults. 

This stage is hard for a lot of them. Very hard!

Someone reached out to me and said she's contemplating suicide. 

She's been home because of the ASUU strike and has been at loggerheads with her parents. 

Nothing she does is Ok and they call her despicable names at every slight chance they get. She is beginning to feel inadequate and useless. 

Growing up, one of the things that frustrated me the most was my parents making assumptions and jumping into conclusions, without even wanting to hear me out. Please don't do this to your children. 

These young adults are not having it easy. If you have been to any institution of higher learning, you should already know how frustrating strikes can be. 

Please a lot of young adults are very frustrated. It's hard trying to find your footing in a world so messed up, especially in a sorry-ass country like this. 

 Please be kind with your words towards your children and your wards. Find time to converse with them. Ask them how they are doing, and how life is treating them. Ask them if they need help with anything and help as much as you can. Reassure them that things will be fine and make efforts to be there for them. 

If you used to send them upkeep money while in school, please as long as you can afford to,  give them something even while they are at home. Every young adult has a need. 

Don't make matters worse by unnecessarily picking on them or being unreasonably unbendable I beg you. 

It's sad knowing that a lot of young adults are happier away from home and their parents. It's really sad. Your home should be a safe haven for your kids and wards, not where they would rather not be. 

Trust me, being unreasonably strict isn't what will make anyone turn out right. If anything, it only breeds sleek, sneaky humans so please give them a little breathing space too. 

I take God beg una🙏

8/5/22, 9:18 AM - +234 818 709 0967: To all business owners this question is for you. 

What would be the essence of branding if the name on your products has already been registered by someone else?

Why hang banners, print flyers and make billboards when you  have not secured the name for yourself?

Let me tell you the truth, it doesn't matter how much you have spent for branding, if someone else beats you to the test of registering your business name, you will have to let it go.

Your CAC certificate is your first brand identity.

Secure your business name in the register of the corporate affairs commission with us at EwaAde Hub NG.

This is the only proof you have that the name is truly yours. 

 The First rule in every business is to make profit. 

Whether you run a coffee shop, super market or even a tech company, you will find  yourself looking for ways to  make more money, and this cannot be achieved if your customer or clients don’t trust you.

Trust is one thing, you must never neglect if you have plans of succeeding in business.
The truth is that nobody wants to lose in business. And anytime money is involved people, people are always cautious. So if they cannot trust you, they most definitely will not do business with you.

But if you register your business it becomes traceable. Your cac certificate declares permanence, it tells your clients that you are here to stay.
 It tells investors, clients or prospective clients that you are not a fly by night company. And so secures their trust. 
 
Take for instance, you have a tech company and you’re not registered. Because of this a customer, potential customer, or even an investor would rather go for an Apple or Samsung.

Why?

1. Because they will get a warranty or guarantee.
2. Because the above-mentioned companies are registered and are legally bound.
3. Customers can get a repair or exchange the item if something is not up to standard.
So you see, you need to secure the trust of your prospective clients, clients and investors to get ahead in business.
My advice is this, decide to make your company the people’s first choice today by simply putting your leg forward to register it. With a very affordable amount, and within a few days your business is certified for life.
You know what?

So that's y am urging us to give LADO having seen his combo so far the chance in coming election.  I rather channel my energy to campaign for new change rather than argument.

8/6/22, 8:54 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): LETTER OF RESIGNATION

 I write to appreciate the leadership of All Progressives Congress for given me the opportunity to test my popularity among the party faithful in our Constituency, may Almighty God continues to reward you all.

 However, the ugly turn of events in the past few weeks in the Oyo state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has necessitated that I take a firm stand on the future of my political aspiration in line with the wishes of my leaders, supporters, and well-wishers. When I joined the APC some years back, I had the strong conviction that the party would always toil on the path of justice, fairness, and equality.

At that time, I had all reasons to believe the party would always provide a level playing ground for all and sundry regardless of their class or creed. With the unflinching support of our loyal members, we built one of the most formidable groups within the party in Oorelope local government Igboho – even attracting aggrieved members and common folks.

As a young party man, my simple ambition was to represent our optimistic, energetic people at the state house of assembly. That way, our movement grew in leaps and bounds reaching the far end of the community with one simple but equally powerful message: quality and effective representation.

Despite all odds, I am still committed, determined, and undaunted in that quest. Nothing shall stop the change whose time has come. But after careful consultation with my leaders and supporters and deep exploration into the various bones of contentions especially concerning the state house of assembly ticket which I have duly clinched, but which was snatched from me through the backdoor by dangerous usurpers within our party, I hereby tender my letter of resignation from the ALL PROGRESSIVES CONGRESS with immediate effect. Thank you.
Your's Sincerely
                                                                            Signed

*SENATOR AFO*✍️
8/7/22, 6:47 AM - +234 905 302 0945: I was supposed to graduate with a First-Class but made 2:1(second class upper) because a lecturer vowed that I can't be the best student ever in Computer Science Department.

What was my offence?

He said I was so insolent to publicly correct a wrong notion he postulated in class during one of his lectures, also, since he didn't graduate with a First Class then nobody else would be in the department as long as he is alive.

This happened about 12 years ago.

He was the head of the conspiracy that marked me down in my final year...

I was very depressed the day I collected my call-up letter to the National Youth Service Corps and saw I was posted to Kebbi one of the educationally less developed states in the country.

Going out of the school, I met Dr. Irukefe at the walkway and he said " I heard about your posting."

He laughed and continued " It doesn't cost much to give your details to someone at NYSC, I want to see how your computer knowledge will be useful in a state where you can count the number of computers, you felt you know something l will see how you will make it in this profession. Best of Luck". And he walked away.

I was stunned because I wanted to serve in Lagos, so this was how I got Kebbi.

Later, a reliable source told me he said that I should thank my stars that he didn't make me have an extra year in school. 

I didn't know the hatred was so much.
I was diligent in my studies because of my poor background, my parent struggled to send me to school.

I went to the NYSC camp in Dakingari, very discouraged because I wanted to serve in Lagos where an IT firm had promised to pay me 20,000 Naira apart from my NYSC allowance.

Three days to the end of the camp, a man came asking if there is anyone who can repair a Laptop computer. I volunteered and successfully repaired it. He said his thanks, collected my phone number, and left. He didn't even pay me for my effort.
 
I thought I was going to teach in a school, When I received my placement letter, I was shocked that I was posted to the office of the Senator representing one of the constituencies in the state.

I was astonished. More amazed, when my phone rang about an hour and the man who came with the faulty Laptop was waiting for me in a Jeep.

He drove me to meet the senator, who thanked me profusely for saving his laptop because it contained bills that he wanted to sponsor at the Senate for his constituency.

The Senator offered me a job as his Personal Assistant and computer instructor at the computer institute he had set up in the state. He laid down his plans on how he wanted young students in his constituency to be computer literate and I am to be the coordinator.

My salary was over 80,000 Naira, with a furnished apartment, and medical allowance. I had access to his cars, and the first contract I executed made me a millionaire because I was asked to procure laptops and accessories for all the senior civil servants in the state ministries.

His company was given the contract.

It was from this state that I was able to secure a scholarship to study after three years of working with my principal after NYSC. He didn't want me to go because the computer school was a success story but he facilitated my comfortable arrival in the United States.

All this happened within 12 years. 

I have a Ph.D. in Forensic and Information Technology.  

Not quite a long I was speaking at the conference of World Forensic Scientists in Japan. After delivering my lecture, there was a standing ovation from the participants all over the world.

Among them was my old-time lecturer, after the proceeding, I walked up and greeted him, he acted like he couldn't recall who I was so I reminded his exact words which were "let me see how you will make it in this profession. I am the boy you said those words to.

He was astonished. 

I advised, "try to be a mentor to the young students, you don't know who and what they will become." 

"Not only have I made it from this profession but internationally am recognized, you must have been seeing my publications, It was I who paid $5500 to sponsor your trip for this conference under the auspices of GRAND Inc. I owed the company.

"Sir, yearly you will be invited, to speak at a conference like this, it's my way of saying thank you for influencing my posting to Kebbi state that particular year. If you had not done it I would not have made it to where I am today. You meant evil but God turn it into good.

"I hope your hotel room (Room 312) has a nice view of Tokyo?"

He stood rooted to the spot, he was too dazed to speak as I was taken away to meet other professionals in the tech business.

He later sent a mail of apology

when ASUU went on strike, I was informed he was boasting at the department in Nigeria that he is the only lecturer in Africa, who was invited to participate at the GRAND Inc World Conference and subsequently he would be one of the speakers. I guess a leopard never changes its spot.

I am glad he is not poor but he didn't meet me where he left me 12 years ago.

No matter what anyone does to you, continue to be hardworking, a man's gift one day will always make a way for him.

*Okay guys, reality is about to hit the labour market especially the Private Sector. Read the post and comments for understanding.*

*I know to some of us, we're tired of the entire stress that comes with Job hunting but the single truth is; are we as an individual ready to take up the challenge when it shows.*

I started job hunting while I was still in 400 level 2nd Semester because I already have an idea of what the market is saying (some of us don't) even though I know that I am 100% qualified yet but I still damn the consequence.

I later realized that the labour market is *no longer certificate based but rather skilled based*. It took me years to figured that out and yet I find it difficult to navigate.... WHY? Because I have programmed my mind to a certain way of teaching and I wasn't willing to take online classes. Guess who is now taking online classes 😅...

*All I am trying to say is that; Your certificate won't be enough, you need to get yourself some skills to level up.* This is what our educational system should have adopted but we are still using the archaic style of teaching.

*The next 3 months will open opportunities for a lot of prepared individuals as everyone don dey JAPA. So don't sleep on it and skill up 😜*

8/7/22, 11:02 AM - +234 814 235 8262: A STERN WARNING TO NANS 2022 CPC AND SUNDAY ASEFON LED LEADERSHIP TO TOW THE PATH OF LEGALITY. 

It has become imperative to openly address the illegal, barbaric and non progressive activities of some elements involved in the NANS National Convention Planning Committee (CPC) and their co enabler, Sunday Asefon. Since the beginning of the election process which started few weeks back after the incumbent leadership was forced to set up a CPC at the expiration of their tenure, the outgoing leaders have relentlessly shown that they are unwilling to leave office or rather polarise at their exit, the left glory of the Association that has been so much guided by few relevant stakeholders even as the outgoing leadership engaged in series of disgraceful attitudes. 

In the last few days, there has been series of misuse of power, abuse of office and subjugation of the NANS Constitution by the CPC under the influence of the outgoing leadership to cause confusion and unjustly deny credible aspirants especially from the South West zone from contesting. The new amendment in the constitution clearly states the criteria to contest in an election of NANS. It is only disappointing that in a bid to technically deny some aspirants their rights, some members of the  CPC particularly the Secretary, has jettisoned relevant provisions of the constitution for their selfish interest. Such relevant provisions are that; an aspirant must have spent at least a session in the institution on which platform he’s contesting, only full time students with credible records can contest and to cite but a few. 

It is unfortunate that in a bid to disenfranchise credible people of our zone, these provisions are substituted for exact opposite of what they mean where part time candidates and ‘students’ who had barely spent months in an institution are given consideration at the expense of constitutionally qualified persons. This is obviously the plan of Sunday Asefon, the CPC Secretary and several other persons in his executives who are not known students of any institution to handover by all means to non students like them. While we have patiently tried to guide the image of NANS after the unpopular emergence and leadership of the incumbency had drawn it backward with disgraceful actions, we will not watch till the Association is torn apart at their exit. We will apply all legally and politically correct actions to ensure the unconstitutional, fascist and selfish plans of the CPC and National Executives are crushed. 

By this special statement, a note of warning is served on the CPC and the outgoing leadership to quickly redress their steps and refrain from all unconstitutional plans, which include impromptu change of offices allocated to each zone. We will not hesitate to apply all legally and politically permissible instrument to crush these reckless plans. It is also to enjoin them to stick to the rational tradition of the Association and that while they correct their intended abnormalities, no postponement of the election shall be entertained as the time is overdue.

Like who you voted for will affect your account balance if the person doesn't win

Criticize Buhari and the APC plus the recent flag bearer till the 1st qrt of this year only to wake up last week and start to sing praises of the same thing they have been criticising... 

They're even ending their support with *"hopefully he won't disappoint us like Buhari did"*

The chances of their marriage failing are the same as yours. 

Stop investing your emotions in that ancient fiction called karma. 

Your ex is out there happy and enjoying his/her new life, and has probably forgotten that you exist.

In Ibadan, if your street light on this week, no expect an next week cos money to buy diesel no dey…

Last night, I drove from gate to Idi Ape (street lights on)

From Idi Ape to Iwo Road (street lights off)!

Same thing we abuse Amosun for (he did same in Ijebu Ode that year)!

How do you spend that much(28 fucking billion naira) only to be having a recurrent expenditure on diesel daily/weekly/monthly basis?

They were going for marriage counselling before the wedding…

The counsellor told them…

1. They should try avoid recurrent sex
2. They should try keep it at two or max three in a week

Lo and behold, dude is one who can do this everyday for a whole month (don’t want to exaggerate)

Baba left counselling and told his wife to be, “if you like let them push you to fire, I am having sex with you everyday, everywhere and anyhow.”

@2348102069268  The text above sir👆
8/12/22, 3:33 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): So it’s commision based?
8/12/22, 3:34 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): So it’s wrong to marry someone richer than you?
8/12/22, 3:34 PM - +234 706 342 5524: When did I say so?
8/12/22, 3:35 PM - +234 701 829 9983: Your dm sir
8/12/22, 3:35 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): I’m sorry ma 

Kindly explain what ‘That’s why it’s advisable to marry your level’ means 

And explain the immediate sentence that followed it
8/12/22, 3:35 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Maybe I quoted you out of context

8/12/22, 3:37 PM - +234 706 342 5524: "It's advisable" is different from its compulsory"

It's your choice

Besides,I was reacting to the above screenshot
Their marriage failed doesn't mean there are no better marriages out there
8/12/22, 3:38 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Don’t twist it 
Okay, I’ll rephrase using your language 

So it’s not advisable to marry someone above your level?
8/12/22, 3:39 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): So you know because their marriage failed doesn’t mean there are no successful marriages outside  but you already say ‘That’s why it’s not advisable to marry someone above your level’

Make it make sense ma.
8/12/22, 3:39 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): E sha ma rora
8/12/22, 3:39 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Marrying someone above or below your level is not what determines marriage success
8/12/22, 3:39 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): You just contradicted yourself here
8/12/22, 3:40 PM - +234 706 342 5524: My dear, If this one is not explanatory enough just stick to whatever opinion what have..
8/12/22, 3:41 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): It’s not explanatory AT ALL

Cos it’s not even explanatory to you Sev

You wanted to make sense at all cost but ended up shooting yourself in the leg by airing 2 opposing opinions 

Take you L.

I wanted to make sense?

Of course, who wants to sound foolish and dumb?
8/12/22, 3:43 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Wanting to make sense shouldn’t make you air opposing opinions, ma
8/12/22, 3:43 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): 😂
8/12/22, 3:44 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): A. 
It’s not advisable to marry someone above your level 

B. 
That their marriage failed doesn’t mean there are no successful marriages 

How the 2 relate, Koyemi. Ko add up
8/12/22, 3:45 PM - +234 706 342 5524: Don't be confused😂😂😂


I freely expressed myself dear
Do yours too...
Atleast the sender dropped it here for everyone to drop his or her own opinion👌
8/12/22, 3:46 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): You shouldn’t confuse us while dropping your opinion.
8/12/22, 3:46 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): And it was brought here so it will be discussed and debated on. And we can learn from
8/12/22, 3:47 PM - +234 706 342 5524: Is it possible to confuse you if you already had a solid opinion?
8/12/22, 3:48 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): If it’s for personal consumption, it would have been dropped in DM 

Opinions can be free truly but facts are sacred. 

That’s you’re free to air your opinion doesn’t give liberty to now feed us with whatever. 

Don’t contaminate the little knowledge on our head o

8/12/22, 3:51 PM - +234 706 342 5524: Same way I don't feed on whatever it's been dropped here(from you specifically) unless it's been filtered

I'm free to air my opinion,it's your choice to feed on it or throw it away..
8/12/22, 3:56 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Not necessary you drop opinion on everything tho. 

And this isn’t even about the opinion you dropped again, it’s about the fact that you contradicted yourself. 
You didn’t stop at that, you tried to evade explaining how the 2 can work together by saying you won’t explain further.

It’s fine anyways. 
But next time, choose your side carefully before dropping. There may be 1 or 2 persons who hold on to what you drop. Don’t confuse them 

We would take this as an important disclaimer if you however feel no one should take you seriously as you’re just dropping your opinion as you’re free to.

8/12/22, 11:53 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): There are people with strong abandonment issues. Big problem letting anyone out of their lives because there's a surreal fear that they would end up miserable without these people. 

They would do anything to preserve the relationship and this has little to do with love. You see women who put up with abusive boyfriends and this is not because they can't do better, they're just too afraid to try.

So when their boyfriends beat them  they still can't leave the relationship because the fear of being alone is stronger whatever physical pain they have to endure.

8/14/22, 3:02 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): <Media omitted>
8/14/22, 3:02 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Exactly 

They told me point blank that’s why it will be delayed
8/14/22, 3:08 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Hope you've the officer name
8/14/22, 3:09 PM - +234 703 689 6288: That's the problem

They will not hear your file

That's the corruption in the immigration service
8/14/22, 3:10 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Typically, it should take how many weeks please?
8/14/22, 3:10 PM - +234 703 689 6288: Normally it shouldn't be delayed, but because they won't have opportunity of getting their own tip from it, they won't attend to it

Except you have a topic government officer that can call them, I'm afraid they won't attend to it 

Another option is to give Caesar what belong to Caesar
8/14/22, 3:11 PM - +234 703 689 6288: With the new one they are doing now, jale jale, one month

8/14/22, 3:12 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Make dem reply the friendly tweet first

After then, we may have to drag each other
8/14/22, 3:12 PM - +234 703 689 6288: I will be interested in the twitter outcome sha
8/14/22, 3:12 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Abeokuta
8/14/22, 3:13 PM - +234 703 689 6288: Ok

I met him there some years back when I went for renewal. And he has been helpful to loads of people and Tasuedites through him.
8/14/22, 3:21 PM - +234 818 709 0967: He losses nothing using that twitter link
8/14/22, 3:21 PM - +234 813 288 6674: If you can't provide adequate information like the name of the said officer, you will just get a random response.

I can bet it that even if you know someone that works at Immigration, you will still have to tip them or get your stuff delayed
8/14/22, 3:22 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Stories I love to hear 💙

That's what our emeritus Senate President @2348163162679 was trying to avoid by going ahead to register online

Nigeria can happen to them at immigration now, and they will say their server is down for several days, weeks and months...

8/14/22, 3:54 PM - +234 703 689 6288: They've changed the process, if you no come know anybody... You can come for capturing today and it will not reach your turn, they will reschedule you again and again... That's experience is not pleasant at all
8/14/22, 3:55 PM - +234 807 434 7813: Haa NIN

You don't dismissed a Person who has been trained on how to handle arms of different types, who has undergone series of rigorous training. These are the ones that form a gang of terrorists in out community, people like that are kept behind bars for the whole of their life.

Replacement isn't hard in the military Sir.

Let people point out who is telling lies confidently. And how they don't want him. 

Questioning/attacking Asiwaju Tinubu on age, daughter age, certificate, "eleyi", etc are all moral. Simply moral and have nothing to do with if he'll be a better president or not. But people did it and doing it. 

So, no shifting of goal post. We'll question Atiku Corruption profile and achievements as former VP and contribution to the nation when he was in charge, too. Moral moral moral binding.

The tides is changing and the momentum into 2023 is entirely different from what we are used to.... Hence the need for your principal to grant interview....

And don't use "he understands the game better" as cover-up

8/15/22, 8:03 AM - +234 703 446 8168: All newly appointed lecturers don’t collect that but never forget that there’s always a chance to grow, they are pensionable and job security is guaranteed.


But on Gawd, it’s a great start for freshers!
8/15/22, 8:05 AM - +234 813 948 8163: Exactly my point too.

I no fee dey that work they believe i don see work but na little beginning at least
8/15/22, 8:05 AM - +234 703 446 8168: I started with 40k and possible 40k bonus (depending on KPI).

Inside same company after 6 weeks, I got promoted and was earning at 70-90k in 17 days plus bonuses and tips from contractors.

100k for a start with guaranteed accommodation which you’re most likely not going to spend on transportation is a good deal 💯
8/15/22, 8:07 AM - +234 813 948 8163: You are always on point baba ogbon🙌❤️
8/15/22, 8:09 AM - +234 703 446 8168: The job is beyond little beginning if only you know how people are looking for job!


A babe just spoke to me 2 days ago that she needs a job of at least 20k salary (less than 1k daily).

Wallahi na moderately huge beginning … if you have the chance, take it without thinking twice!

It means you can save at least 200/250k in a year cos you don’t do transport and accommodation!

You go even ball inside your remaining 70k after saving 30k!

Just buy foodstuff of 25k, buy gas of 7/8k and carry olosho 😂

8/15/22, 8:14 AM - +234 816 463 6464: Using Lagos as a case study;

A standard bedroom at least will be 300k/annum, on 100k monthly salary which is equivalent to 1.2M/annum that's like 40% of the annual salary saved plus transportation cost which is likely to be zero amount, that's like 60% salary saved.....

Same department and had same CGPA with this boy here but he was second by 0.001 (insignificant figure became significant cos there can’t be two bests)

Until then!

Don’t be carried away, school is not scam, book is not scam, education isn’t scam!

An intern is not expected to know it all…

Basic knowledge is enough…

Some companies will not take you in if you know too much about the skills they need you to learn on the job.

How do you expect them to do their evaluation at the end of the internship?

He’s from my party and with no doubt I’m an APC person not just that but a stakeholder at that.
8/17/22, 11:42 PM - +234 706 452 6359: But by my own view I work on antecedents 

Looking at Tinubu’s achievements as an ex governor of Lagos state under Obasanjo as the then president of Nigeria.

I respective of the hardship Tinubu faced because he was the only APC Governor during the regime ,he still make sure that he never owe any salary of any worker in which everyone can testify
8/17/22, 11:42 PM - Java ✊🏾: <Media omitted>
8/17/22, 11:43 PM - +234 815 533 0053: Was he supposed to owe salary before? Na free work the civil servants dey do?
8/17/22, 11:43 PM - +234 706 452 6359: In terms of infrastructure he did perfectly well,not saying he didn’t steal but I myself can see what he has done so far 


He made NECO free under his administration due to a story I heard that because people were begging his mom mogaji Tinubu for money so as for there children will be able to seat for NECO ,when Tinubu heard of this immediately he made NECO free under his administration up till now it’s still free in Lagos.
8/17/22, 11:43 PM - +234 706 452 6359: Na every governor dae pay on time ?
8/17/22, 11:43 PM - +234 807 434 7813: This one no be point

8/17/22, 11:44 PM - +234 807 434 7813: So if he emerge NECO will be free in Nigeria?
8/17/22, 11:45 PM - +234 706 452 6359: Adopt nii 

But he no concern me

8/17/22, 11:45 PM - +234 706 452 6359: What do I mean by Inter ethnicity 

Yoruba wants this slots to come to there own place 
Hausa believes they’re in power they don’t want to leave it
Igbo too wants to by all means.

But during Tinubu administration he made Lagos bearable and welcomes all tribe lol the Lagos they are now calling a no man’s land.

We’ll see the achievements he has done during his governor of Lagos state under real hardship just because the opposition wants to ruin is reign.

So he coming now promising what he has done for Lagos back then to Nigeria is not a bad idea.

8/17/22, 11:49 PM - +234 706 452 6359: The only thing i realize after my findings is that he’s old now to be president but looking at America president he’s also old as welll at his seventies I guess and he’s still doing perfectly well in American.

Moreover,one thing I was taught in politics is that ruler is from the head (brain) not from the hand ,those that can work and you see they are fits should go into the military while the brilliant ones should serve under the administration.

I see Tinubu as a wise person who can rule and direct people.
8/17/22, 11:49 PM - +234 807 434 7813: Because people don forget Baba for Lagos state governor oo

8/18/22, 12:02 PM - SALAKO💎: *🔥🔥 UPDATE 🔥🔥*

*Summary of Min. Adamu Press Briefing on ASUU STRIKE negotiation Developments.*

FG has not approved UTAS but UTAS scored higher than U3PS and IPPIS. The committee are still working on UTAS. One major bone of contention is the Provision for Salary payment during sabbatical which the HM believes can get worked into the Software of any payment system.

Min. Adamu said he met with all the unions (NAAT, NASU, SSANU and ASUU) and they all accepted the offers presented only ASUU rejected by giving two extra conditions before calling off Strike. 

The Minister said FG will not accept the two conditions given by ASUU. One of which is to pay the 5 months withheld salaries. He said the  'No work, No pay' system is the the major way to avoid further Strikes and to punish ASUU for shutting down Tertiary Institutions because of revitalization.

Adamu also said that all the Unions have gone back to consult with their members to discuss the new offer. He is Optimistic that all unions will call off strike within next week but he's not sure of ASUU. He is to get the reports from NASU and SSANU Tomorrow

All the unions will meet Nimi Briggs' committee tomorrow to conclude on the negotiation. 

FG also proposed and approved Salary raise for the University Lecturers.

You read out Promises of the APC  in 2015 and tagged them empty, as retrogression is the reality as of today, according to you .
Now you are saying you brought your agenda, cause we used an agenda, that’s not some sort of subjectivity to the Apc agenda of 2015? 

It’s simply cause APC did it in 2015, You think it’s right for you to do it in 2023 😂

8/18/22, 5:00 PM - +234 808 351 8616: Check out this job at Intercity NG: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3219979681
8/18/22, 8:27 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Having keenly observed and monitored developments in the power sector within the last 24 hours, I am again convinced that my solution to the electricity crisis, as encapsulated in my Policy Document, My Covenant with Nigerians,  remains the most proactive plan to lead Nigeria out of darkness.

In this regard, my approach is to first remove the entire electricity value chain from the exclusive list and give states the power to generate, transmit and distribute electricity for themselves. An industrial dispute with the FG in Abuja should not affect an industry in Lagos or a factory in Aba or in Kano or even an average Nigerian who just wants to get home, watch the news and sleep under a ceiling fan.

Secondly, my policy shall aim at achieving greater coordination of investments in the entire electricity value chain. Investments in additional generation capacity are futile without consideration for the complementary transmission and distribution infrastructure to wheel the additional energy.
 
Any investment in additional generation capacity would be competitively procured considering a viable mix of renewable (hydro, solar, wind and biofuels) and non-renewable (coal, gas) options for energy security.

Thirdly, ahead of procuring additional generation, both transmission and distribution capacities would be enhanced with government and private sector support for investments. In this regard, we shall incentivize private investors to invest in the development of multiple green-field mini-grid transmission systems to be looped into the super-grip in the medium to long term while allowing the FG focus on policy, regulation, and standardization. 

My aspiration to be President is to protect the interest of the average Nigerian in all circumstances, and on this, I stand to say that I have no interest either directly or indirectly in any generator company, as has been publicly revealed. -AA

8/18/22, 8:41 PM - +234 816 463 6464: This is a brilliant approach to our Electricity problem and it's a welcome address.

My concern is; why was it difficult for BRF to push the exclusive list removal to PMB?
8/18/22, 8:44 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Privatization as usual From AA. Not bad sha anyways he as generator company 😂
8/18/22, 8:46 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Proof to your claim sir
8/18/22, 8:47 PM - +234 810 619 9957: That he as a generator company. Give me proof the Bat owns Oriental hotel or Emperor Estate Ajah if u can I will give u proof too
8/18/22, 8:50 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Did you read?
8/18/22, 8:50 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Read what bro?
8/18/22, 8:50 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Funny how educated folks still want to argue privatization as the way forward
8/18/22, 8:50 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): You didn’t read the what I sent
8/18/22, 8:51 PM - +234 810 619 9957: I did
8/18/22, 8:51 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): If you did, you won’t add that he has a generator company
8/18/22, 8:51 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Am only saying AA is suggesting privatization as usual
8/18/22, 8:53 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): Adding that he has a generator company has given it another meaning entirely 

And by the way, Atiku does not own a generator company 

It’s not too late to relearn and purge out the propaganda you’ve been fed with long ago
8/18/22, 8:53 PM - +234 810 619 9957: He is campaigning at the end of the right up that he doesn’t have any interest in a generator company directly or indirectly. That doesn’t mean he doesn’t own a generator company or large percentage in one
8/18/22, 8:54 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): What does it mean not to have interest either directly or indirectly in a generator company?
8/18/22, 8:54 PM - +234 816 463 6464: You see me write here say BAT owns what you typed there 🤣

You associate person with a company and to provide proof con hard you 😂

8/18/22, 8:56 PM - Ifedayo (JIMCRUZ): They may be 

What differentiates me from them is I don’t feed on what I see or read online 

If I’m not convinced enough, I don’t carry it about. 

Ever heard me say lagbaja owns this and that? I don’t feed on those shii
8/18/22, 8:56 PM - +234 810 619 9957: Am not disputing that fact u, you are going by been logical with the right up which fine but off course there could be more to it that is invisible

And you're about to do it again right

We go dey here together 😁
8/19/22, 9:16 PM - +234 703 446 8168: And the previous Vice Presidents of the United States has been blacks???


Donald Trump VP na black???

Bro, Biden and the Democrats only chose what they felt will make them win the elections considering the way Trump treated the black race and it worked…


Same as Tinubu choosing a Muslim VP cos he felt that will make him stand stronger in the North.

BIDEN’s choice was just to win elections
8/19/22, 9:16 PM - +234 706 342 5524: Nawa o
8/19/22, 9:17 PM - +234 706 452 6359: That’s my personal reasoning not a party thing.

I participated in politics fully this year meaning I have no idea of how buhari was chosen from onset.
8/19/22, 9:18 PM - +234 816 463 6464: Just to bring this back, GMB was also sold to us based on one inter ethnicity kinikan kinikan based on his antecedents as a former HOS

We all know how it's going anyways 😂
8/19/22, 9:19 PM - +234 815 526 0742: 🤔 Tinubu's choice might also be to win elections too ...

8/19/22, 9:23 PM - +234 706 452 6359: On the side of TINUBU chose his vice from north just to be strong, yes you’re right parts of why I said TINUBU might have his reasons for choosing a Muslim as his Vp.

But I’m still on my stands on this religion thing something that was adopted.

Be it Christian Christian 
Be it Muslim Muslim 
Be it Christian Muslim 
Or even Muslim Christian 

Swears all I’m after is a better Nigeria where my future kids will be proud to say this is my country.
8/19/22, 9:23 PM - +234 807 434 7813: You know wentin Christian deh face for north? Even without that Muslim Muslim ticket
8/19/22, 9:24 PM - +234 815 526 0742: Smile when matters that concerns Christians arise will there be swift response needed! In a country like Nigeria That's Religiously rotten ?
8/19/22, 9:24 PM - +234 706 452 6359: You see politically ehn vice na just figure head post Walahi 

So why emphasizing more on Vp thing.
8/19/22, 9:25 PM - +234 815 526 0742: When there's no proper Rep
8/19/22, 9:25 PM - +234 703 446 8168: It’s not to win but to correct your impression (which I know meant no harm.

You asked if the young man understands the word “inclusion?” and you laid claim that “even POTUS chose black in Kamala Harris to satisfy inclusion.”

FLAWS
1. You used POTUS which means the President of The United States 🇺🇸 in general and not POTUS 46.

2. I had to clear you that it’s not a general thing to include race in the POTUS and his VP since the American 🇺🇸 law states all races being same, so no reason to say inclusion when the law already included them by not separating the races.

3. POTUS 45 (Donald J. Trump) had a white VP, Mike Pence…if inclusion is a thing, the American President and VP will be one black, one white.

VERDICT
Both POTUS 46 (Joe Biden) and TINUBU are only after winning the election by taking advantage of the black race and the Northern Nigeria 🇳🇬 Muslims respectively.
8/19/22, 9:26 PM - +234 815 526 0742: Wow
8/19/22, 9:26 PM - +234 816 463 6464: It's your last paragraph for me 😹

As some camps in Chelsea favor the English international as a long term replacement for their ageing defense line.

More so, they are looking to offload pulisic since sterling and his injury records ain't helping matters.

8/20/22, 8:55 PM - +234 903 224 4825: Funding and history of the 2nd Niger Bridge.

This bridge was proposed by President Shehu Shagari from Sokoto, a Northerner, a Muslim, North West. 

Shagari approved the design of the project but was ousted from power by Gen Buhari. 

Then, in 1987, IBB also approved an improved design. 

Fast forward 

Obasanjo, a Christian, South West flagged off the project in Asaba in year 2003,but could not execute it. 

My man, Yar Adua a Muslim, North West now approved that the Project should be executed under a Public Private Partnership. 

Recall ObJ approved N58.6bn when Atiku from North East was VP

Yar  Adua approved that 60% should come from the contractor : GITTO GROUP (you know what happened to GITTO, make we leave that story) : 20% from FG not Yar Adua and 10% from Anambra and Delta states. 

Unfortunately, for Yar Adua, the project was SUSPENDED.

Then Goodluck Jonathan, a Son of the soil, South South, a Christian approved in August 2012 via Federal Executive Council a sum of N325m for the new design of the bridge. Don’t forget, Shagari, IBB, OBJ had approved and money paid for this design.

GITTO could not execute the project. 

So, PPP died. 

Julius Berger was brought in to replace GITTO. 

So, President Buhari, a Muslim, North West decided to establish a Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund ( PIDF )  that all Governor approved during National Economic Council to fund 

The  Governors agreed that a sum of $650m should be transferred from Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas dividend account at CBN as initial seed to fund projects critical to nation development as we can not rely on budgetary allocation.

The project was awarded to Julius Berger for a sum of N206bn by NSIA via Federal Ministry of Works&Housing and approved by FG not Buhari. 

Again, PPP did not work and died. 

Then, our daddy from North West, Gen Abacha ‘s loot came in to fund the project too. 

North West  played a role 

North West played a significant role and Muslim also to complete the second Niger Bridge located in Christian populated South East. 

The project was reviewed in three phases . 

The first phase was N206bn; 

Second phase: N88.09bn; 

Third phase: N112.09bn. 

Combined cost is N406.2bn

A new company was introduced to help Julius Berger called Reynolds Construction Company on 8th October 2019 that is construction of 17.5km 

My own Onitsha link road ( Onitsha to Okpa Enugu Expressway) and its associated infrastructure.

Don’t forget that National Economic Council also approved that $250m should be deducted from OUR FAMOUS EXCESS CRUDE OIL ACCOUNT to the Nigerian Sovereign Wealth Fund. 

That is part of Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund. 

You see why excess crude account was spent?

As at July, FG not Buhari not NSIA has released a sum of N157bn and the work is 91% complete. 

One of the iconic and legacy projects FUNDED by President Buhari’s government 

Don’t forget we have money recovered from Past Democratic Party’s ( PDP) members looted was also used in funding.

Christmas will be so fun this year as we shall all snapped pictures at the Iconic, Muhammadu Buhari Niger Bridge. 

Also, PIDF also funding Lagos - Ibadan Expressway as well as Abuja - Kaduna - Kano expressway road project. 

Enjoy your weekend and stop giving FAKE information that GEJ paid in FULL!

Thanks to the good people of North West for making sure that Second Niger Bridge now known as Muhammadu Buhari Niger Bridge is now a REALITY.

Anambra and Delta states government did not eventually contribute 10% to the funding of Second Niger Bridge.

Hon Chuma Nzeribe led the battle that FG not Buhari should fund the project

8/20/22, 8:55 PM - +234 903 224 4825: 2ND RIVER NIGER BRIDGE: STATING THE FACTS AND BUSTING THE LIES.

▪︎ Jonathan Paid For The Bridge ..
▪︎ The height Of The Bridge Was Reduced So Ships Can't Pass Under ..

By Dr Uche Diala 

First, the checkered history and deceit of the 2nd Niger Bridge.

After decades of rigmarole by successive military regimes, successive PDP administrations promised to build the 2nd Niger Bridge during their 1999, 2003 and 2007 Presidential election campaigns. It did not. 

Upon the return to civilian rule on May 29, 1999, President Olusegun Obasanjo promised to deliver a second Niger River bridge.

However, Obasanjo’s administration did not carry out any major activity on the project until five days before he handed over in 2007 to the administration of late President Umaru Musa Yar’ Adua. That was when he flagged off the project in Asaba in Delta State.

The handing over of the project by Obasanjo to Yar’ Adua made his (Yar'adua's) administration to effectively inherit a ₦58.6 Billion proposed cost for a six lane, 1.8 km tolled bridge, which was to be completed in three-and-half years.

Based on the funding structure then, the bridge was to be financed under a public-private partnership (PPP) with 60 per cent of the funding coming from the contractor, Gitto Group; 20 per cent from the federal government and 10 per cent from the Anambra and Delta State Governments.

Unfortunately, the subsequent death of Yar’ Adua on May 5, 2010 marred the progress of the project. 

During the 2011 Presidential Campaign, President Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan took the rigmarole a notch higher by promising the respected Obi of Onitsha and by extention the South East at an Onitsha Town Hall meeting that he will construct the bridge and if he did not complete it by 2015, he "will go on exile". That is a direct quote. He won the election.

In the lead up to the 2015 Presidential elections, on March 10, 2014, President Jonathan alongside Mr Peter Obi and other PDP stalwarts went to the bridge site for a flag off excercie where he showcased what he said was a map of the bridge. It is on record. 

Thus for 4 years (2011 - 2015), the Goodluck Jonathan led PDP administration did nothing worth mentioning on the bridge except a completed map of the bridge. There was not even a settled and effective source of and arrangement for funding agreed. 

It bears mentioning that no leader worthy of note from the South East reminded him (President Jonathan) of the public promise he made to the Obi of Onitsha 4 years earlier; to even get an explanation or apology. The South East still resolutely stuck with him and essentially lost the election with him. The South East was rather fed that Buhari hated Igbos and most swallowed it hook, line and sinker. 

Yet the same Buhari came in 2015 and resolved to end that perpetual deceit of the South East and Nigerians in his resolve to do right for the nation without minding who it will directly benefit. 

In August 2015; after scrutinizing the contract cost and other conditions surrounding the Second Niger Bridge project, President Buhari cancelled the moribund and unproductive N325 Million contract approved in 2012 by President Goodluck Jonathan for final planning and design of the bridge under the same Obasanjo PPP model with Gitto Group; which never came through.

The bridge was then redesigned by the Buhari administration to bring it up to modern and efficient standards; adding an extra lane and Bypasses plus a tolling plaza to make the bridge sustainable after construction; in line the new policy of tolling certain bridges and highways nationwide. 

I mean we were used to toll gates which are meant for not only maintaining such infrastructure but building new ones until corruption took them over. Would it be preferable that a bridge was built with tolling or that no bridge was built and no tolling. The 2nd Niger Bridge won't be the only bridge or highway that would be tolled nationwide by the way.

Under the new arrangement, the scope of work was expanded to involve the construction of a 1.6km bridge over the River Niger, construction of two secondary bridges at Amakom Village Road and Atani Road spanning 21.7 meters each, demolition of existing flyover and construction of new interchange at Onitsha-Owerri Road.

The re-design also involved the construction of 3.3km Approach road on the Asaba side and 7.0km approach road on the Onitsha side of the main bridge (a total of 11.9km link roads), a toll plaza which consists of eight lanes in each direction, and site clearing of the Right of Way (RoW) including the removal of all bush, trees and shrubs.

A fresh contract at initial sum of N206 billion was signed in 2018 with Julius Berger Nigeria to be funded by the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF); a Fund created by President Buhari to accelerate the completion of key infrastructure projects; including the Lagos - Ibadan Expressway and the Abuja - Kaduna - Kano (AKK) road.

On the source of funding and nature of the project as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement, apart from the federal government seed funds through budgetary allocations, the recoveries made from Abacha loot, as part of the Presidential  Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF), the Nigerian Sovereign Investment  Authority (NSIA) was also expected to bring in other private capital which is expected to be recouped, with of course returns.

Construction of the bridge started on September 1, 2018 with an expected completion date of February 2022 and JBN kept updating Nigerians on the steady progress of the construction since then. 

Today, we can say without any iota of doubt that the 2nd Niger Bridge is as good as done. Thus the promise made by President Muhammadu Buhari to Nigerians on October 8, 2020 that his administration would complete and commission the Second Niger Bridge before the end of his tenure in 2023 which many people did not take seriously because of our experiences has been faithfully kept.

At this point, it bears addressing the ignorant submission by some ignorance and hate driven folks about the height of the new 2nd Niger Bridge and shipping vessels. 

First, the management of Nigeria Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) under the Buhari Administration during the redesign of the 2nd Niger bridge met with Julius Berger Nigeria Ltd and agreed on the height of the bridge because vessels were expected to turn under the bridge and that was factored in. 

It might help to educate some people that Onitsha is a River Port and not a Sea Port. It can only accommodate flat bottomed vessels. Indeed there are no sea ports in Nigeria that can take ocean going vessels. Such vessels tranship on the Atlantic ocean into smaller vessels which can now come into Nigerian waters.

It might also interest some to know that the Onitsha River Port was moribund all through the decades until once again, under President Buhari, the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) headed by Dr George Moghalu in July 2022 concessioned it to Universal Elysium Consortium Ltd led by Dr George Nwangwu for a 30 year period in a process midwifed by the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC). The federal government will now dredge the river or the Concessionaire would and recover the costs over time.

So today, we have the 2nd Niger Bridge finally built and the Onitsha River Port finally activated and concessioned meaning that barges can now pass under the bridge into Onitsha River Port; all made possible by President Buhari in record time. Think about the huge benefits and the ripple effects to the South East and the rest of Nigeria.

And all Buhari gets are denials, distortion of facts, abuse and discredit?

Thankfully, Buhari is not interested in commendations. He is doing what he believes is right for the nation and posterity will judge him. We only acknowledge and commend for our own human dignity, sense of decency and conscience.

PO isn't headache for APC. It's a huge advantage for APC that he is on the ballot. 

It's just a motivation to make him feel among.

He will come DISTANT THIRD. If care is not taken, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso would even be third. 

So, don't get fixated. It's part of the process.

It is as simple as ABC, lemme use tradition for example. In cosmas today, we have no structure to win but we can get cheers for our candidates but we know that the stakeholders in each dept of cosmas woud work for their candidates to win against our no structure candidate in cosmas.

Would you expect Peter Obi to win in Oyo even with all d gen z and noise in Oyo when GSM is still d governor and in PDP. The political structure in Oyo today favors PDP.

Osun state was also an example of structure but we Jes like to dey spin arguments.

But its good to always have this funny convos most times

8/22/22, 1:48 PM - +234 816 463 6464: PDP won in Osun with structure right?

APC couldn't win because their structure is not strong or because there's a party with a better structure...

Oyo APC in 2019 with structure and being the ruling party lose to Oyo PDP with a lesser structure right?

My point is which is also what you stated earlier using tradition cosmas as example is that "Structure is build with people" and LP is doing that on the low forget the noise on SM.....

The players in the APC knows this and that's why we keep seeing the attacks on his person and speech
8/22/22, 1:51 PM - +234 816 463 6464: And is that outside his power and jurisdiction
8/22/22, 1:52 PM - +234 817 014 8364: If u say LP is building structure, then it Is welcome.

Make una no dey use the structure talk catch cruise like e no dey important or na rule over

8/22/22, 1:53 PM - +234 817 014 8364: Many have been president before him, I don't think they used the power.

However good speech don't win elections.

Debate don't win it either.

8/23/22, 10:49 AM - +234 903 645 3146: *WHEN MARRIAGE IS A MISTAKE.* 
🧩 An Article worth reading

Most times when a *marriage is in trouble* , people tend to see their Marriage as a *mistake* rather than seeing the *mistakes they are making*  in their marriage. At this point they *regret marrying their wife or husband, begin to think of a new partner, imagine marrying their ex or fantasizing a marriage without issues.* 

Some even divorce or remarry and later wish they had *remained* with their first Spouse, as they find greater trouble in the new spouse. This is because *the first marriage was not a mistake,* and the mistake has not been *discovered yet.* 

So you can remarry as many times as you like, you will still experience problems in marriage until *you discover the mistakes you are making in your marriage and correct them.* 

So divorce or separation is not a solution to consider when you are having problems with your marriage.

When your car has a flat tyre, you do not abandon it, but repair the tyre and move on. 

When we have a headache, no matter how excruciating, we do not cut off the head but take care of the headache.

When a bulb blows out in the room we do not change the room or the house, we replace the bulb and light up the room. 

When we have challenges at work, we do not refuse to go to work, we go there to solve the problems.

So when marriage has an issue, we don't have to try to change the spouse instead of changing the *attitude* that is creating the problem.

Most times when we see some couples enjoying their marriages and enjoying each other to the fullest, we admire and cherish them, but the opposite is seen in our own marriage. The reason is that some people have worked on their marriage *by paying the necessary price* and that is why they are enjoying the fruits of their labour. It is said, “The way you make your bed is the way you will lie on it”. 

Your marriage is as *good* or as *sweet* as you make it. Some couples, because of the *negative things* they are seeing in their marriage, accuse each other of being responsible. They point accusing fingers at each other for being responsible. Some even say many bad things about their spouse, even *calling him or her names;* some think that marrying that man or that woman was a mistake.

 *It is not so, your marriage was not a mistake,* *but you are the mistake.* 

Your *habit* is the mistake
Your *character* is the mistake
Your *manner, anger, unforgiveness, laziness, lack of love, lack of affection, lack of attention, impatience, bitterness, selfishness, ignorance, stinginess, not being considerate, infidelity and lovelessness are the mistakes.* 

*Talking about Bitterness.*

 Some still dream of a marriage with their ex seeing your spouse as a stumbling block. *Wake up* and smell the coffee. Be *content* with your spouse. That *behavior* is your mistake. 

So *get up now* and *build your marriage* because it is not a mistake.
 *Divorce or separation* are never options unless it is LIFE threatening.

*I Beseech Almighty GOD bless all marriages.*
Amen.

*LET'S SEND THIS TO ALL OUR CHILDREN (MARRIED OR YET TO). IT WILL SURELY AMEND A HOME.*

When was the last time you complimented your wife and hit her in the bum bum.

Your wife needs this often to be happy.

Please don't forget to hit the bum... Very important.

I come in peace ✌️
🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
8/23/22, 9:30 PM - +234 814 386 6011: Dear husband,

Your wife say that I should tell you that you need to step up your bedmatics. The missionary is becoming boring and they are requesting for romance with a touch of vawulence.

Let the kisses be breaking glasses, the foreplay be tearing buttons and hooks and let the thrusting be breaking beds.

Lastly, always make sure you hang her legs in the sky for vawulenxe reasons.

This is not my writing.

I speak in vawulence
🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
8/23/22, 9:30 PM - +234 814 386 6011: Dear loving wife, 

Men like and enjoy it when you touch their manhood but they won't tell you.

Don't just open your legs and expect him to last in bed, lead him to last in bed
Motivate him to keep standing.

If you know, you know
8/23/22, 9:30 PM - +234 814 386 6011: My dear loving husband,

If your wife is always dry down there, try as much as possible to appreciate her in whispers, let it come from a place of love and sincerity.

Like I said, in whispers then touch her gently.

Let me come and be going 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️

That's what Lagos has always been doing and makes them years ahead of other state when it comes to social responsibility of Government.....

So it's not about being dumb "but government giving people what they feel they want and deserve"

Ogolonto to Ebute road started before now

Or should I mentioned Agric-Isawo road also...

Abi we should talk about Education and Health Sector....

But firm in Lagos are taking undergraduates/hanging graduates if you can prove your studentship and show evidence of a good grade for internship due to the ongoing strike

Advantages:
You would learn a lot (including tangible skills you could continue learning afterwards)
Gather Experience in can put in your CV in the future
And you will still get stipend for your transport and feeding

Disadvantages
Can be a bit stressful
It would definitely be strange and adjusting to the corporate environment can be a bit awkward at first

8/24/22, 2:23 PM - +234 813 948 8163: I can’t believe this is coming from you sha.

So because there is Oro, church should suspend worshipping their God. Where then is the freedom of religion?


If I must say, Oro worshippers and all this yoruba Traditionists dey always feel entitled, what would cause them to hold to their beliefs, practice and worship.

This is worrisome!

I still don’t get
8/24/22, 2:32 PM - +234 706 342 5524: My dear...I was born and bred in ikorodu
Religion does not make us stupid..

Anytime the towncrier announce that there will be Oro festival
We don't go to church..
Yesterday they did Oro at Ijede
I didn't go work at all
I didn't go for evening service

We are all in the same society so wisdom is profitable to direct
8/24/22, 2:32 PM - +234 813 948 8163: Does wisdom implies that when other people are having their festive, I must abide with their doctrine?
8/24/22, 2:33 PM - +234 815 533 0053: For every Oro there's always a 3,5,7 days announcement for all to be aware, they've played their part in making awareness and I believe this practice is everywhere so you coming here to fault the traditional worshippers is rubbish
8/24/22, 2:33 PM - +234 813 948 8163: And I ask again, is that in accordance with your religion doctrine?
8/24/22, 2:33 PM - +234 813 948 8163: Do you guys even understand what is called religion tolerance?
8/24/22, 2:34 PM - +234 815 533 0053: You dey mind ayigoro
8/24/22, 2:35 PM - +234 706 342 5524: My dear..

What matters is our intimacy with God
Church is just a gathering where we worship
God does not appear to us inside church piaauuun. .
So if we did not go to church for two days,we will not go to hell

8/24/22, 2:37 PM - +234 708 690 0451: 24 After they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax approached Peter and asked, “Does your teacher pay the tax for the upkeep of the temple, like the rest of us?”

25 “Of course he does,” Peter answered.

When Peter walked into the house, and before he had a chance to speak, Jesus spoke up and said, “Peter, I have a question for you. Who pays tolls or taxes to a king? Is tax collected from the king’s own children, or from his subjects?”

26 “From his subjects,” Peter answered.

Jesus replied, “That’s right. The children get off free without paying taxes. 27 But so that we don’t offend them, go to the lake and throw out your hook, and the first fish that rises up will have a coin in its mouth. It will be the exact amount you need to pay the temple tax for both of us.”

8/24/22, 2:38 PM - +234 813 948 8163: Their announcement that I should stop all I do to appease their gods, if that you call religion tolerance, I begin to doubt your education.

Anyways, you can ask around about Iseyin, we are known for annual oro deity that it’s even part of our lineage (Iseyin oro) for the past five years, we haven’t things easy with ourselves on this oro and masquerade performance.

We never say they shouldn’t worship their God but shouldn’t be trampling our religion rights. It led to war 4 to 5 years ago and now I can tell you, they do their things without caging anyone.

You can just go ahead to confirm!
8/24/22, 2:39 PM - +234 813 948 8163: Make your findings oo
8/24/22, 2:39 PM - +234 706 342 5524: In Nigeria,we have 3 major religion
Christianity
Islam
Traditional


There was a particular day I wanted to enter a mosque
I wore trousers and did not cover my hair
The cleric didn't allow me in because their religion does not permit it...

They have rules so I had to step outside respectfully...
That's religion tolerance!

Same with traditional religion,if there is egungun festival going on in a particular place
We have to remove our foot wear else we go chop beating
That's religion tolerance...
8/24/22, 2:40 PM - +234 813 948 8163: I am not a bible reader, does the verse implies that you allow oro to cage you in for days?
8/24/22, 2:40 PM - +234 815 533 0053: You'll be fine
8/24/22, 2:43 PM - +234 708 690 0451: And He Gave them understanding to understand the Scriptures Like 24:45
8/24/22, 2:44 PM - +234 813 948 8163: All these are what we call norms and religion tolerance, you are actually going to meet them and you are to oblige with their doctrine or you leave their worship.

You don’t expect me to enter cele with a shoe, that’s stupid and crazy but when a cele peope says I should go out for day and I oblige, that’s the actual definition of illiteracy and not serious about my own religion.

Many good number pf Muslims will still believe when they see oro, they can be harmed since they don’t understand the concept of their religion.
8/24/22, 2:45 PM - +234 813 948 8163: Shouldn’t *
8/24/22, 2:45 PM - +234 706 342 5524: What's your point exactly
8/24/22, 2:46 PM - +234 706 342 5524: Females should go out to church/mosque/market/school while Oro is on?
8/24/22, 2:46 PM - +234 813 948 8163: That;

I am a Muslim

Have belief in my religion 

 I am tolerant and not stupid

That I believe in the doctrine of my religion

You don't just down other Religions because you're a Muslim.
Religion tolerance is all about accepting each other's beliefs when the time for their festival is going on, just the same way other religions respects all Muslims doing Ramadan and Salah, same is to be done to others too.

The traditionalists are the one with most tolerance, when it comes to handling issues concerning their beliefs, most especially when some pastors and Alfas will talk down on Èṣù, Oya, Orunmila and the likes

I schooled in Isheri Secondary days ORO was a big deal there, dem no born any woman I repeat any woman born of another woman to see ORO and won’t face the wrath of ORO no cap. Even those from the ORO dynasty as certain things they have to do to see ORO anyone that loose guard faces the music not to talk of a stranger and that’s why they usually announce because they no the damage it can cause.
 Regardless of a Christian or a Muslim u have to respect tradition,  we all are Traditionalist right from the days of our forefathers before religion came in.

8/24/22, 9:31 PM - +234 811 852 9190: SOLA KUTI TO BOLA AHMED TINUBU:

You want to be President

Your wife is a Senator

Your daughter Iya Loja that controls all monies and levies generated in all Lagos markets.

Your son, the advertising guru of state account, is in charge of all billboard money generated in Lagos. 

All BRT money goes to your Nephew

Your wife, a Senator, is the official supplier of diesel in all Lagos State formations and including street light generators.

All governmental taxes and other levies goes to you - JAGABAN himself through your consulting firm - Alpha Beta.

You own a mega private hospital inside the state teaching hospital in Lagos.

Your newspaper and TV channel are the official paid propaganda channels. 

You own almost all the remaining valuable real estates in Lagos.

You're entitled to pension 300% amount payable to governors. The law you created by yourself.

You're entitled to change of vehicles yearly and houses both in Lagos and Abuja (minimum 5 bedroom duplex).

All your domestic staff - cooks, gardeners, stewards, drivers, securities etc - are paid by the government and are all pensionable.

You directly control all the machinery of government in Lagos and some Southwest states.

Unless there's something else that is wrong with you and your head, what else are you looking for in the Presidency?

If you have managed all the resources and states you control very well, we should be the ones calling you to be our president.

Not you sharing bags of rice and beans.
Goddamn delusional old man.

8/25/22, 1:26 PM - +234 815 526 0742: The counsellor 1

The middle aged man was seated in his office . It's been 20 years since he started this job. 

Far and near his country, countless cases have been transferred to his office and he has done amazingly well . 

Today was another day of work . 
Another day to help a situation that may seem hopeless . 

His office door opens and an angry looking woman enters .
Her wrapper was almost undone and she  only managed to wear a shoe on one of her legs . 
Her hair was scattered and looking at it, one will only help but notice the dark white batches on the hair. 
It must have been a long time  since this woman had her hair done . 

On her hands was the other pair of shoe . It was  worn out and broken . 

Her blouse was old and tiny black threads were used to patch them together. 
The  tailor of this woman must have been tired of patching this blouse and she must  have  resulted to holding them together with thread and needle. 

Few minutes after she sat down , a tall dark looking man walked into the counsellors office too .

His Ambiance was filled with  grace and elegance . 
The scent from the  cologne on his body filled the room . 
His hair was neatly cut and lined . 
If you looked at them properly, you would find waves and waves on his hair . 
Whoever does his hair must have  been an expert on it . 

His shoes sparkled and  they matched the neatly tailored designs on the neck of his traditional wear. 

The counsellor adjusted his seat and stood up to greet his clients . 
Nothing scarred him .

"Good morning, And welcome to my office" . The counsellor greeted with a smile . 

" Good morning sir" The man smiled and stretched forth his hands to shake the counsellor . 

The woman Ignored them and fixed her gaze forward. 

" How many I address you " 
The counsellor asked with a smile  after they sat down . 

" We are are Mr and Mrs james " 
The man said proudly, in a boostful manner as one who is proud of His home . 

" You live in the same house together as husband and wife ? "
The counsellor asked surprised. 

"Yes, this is my dear wife ". The excited man responded .

The counsellor shifted his eyes to the woman and then to the man and back to the woman . 

 Looking at the appearance of the people seated in his office, one would think, The man had brought in a mad woman he saw on the road for rehabilitation 

" This is going to be tough" . The counsellor muttered to himself and adjusted his belt .

8/26/22, 6:53 AM - +234 903 224 4825: When a plant or crop provides fruits, it's as a result of maturity and moments of consistent nurturing. The farmer that planted it, do weeding, waters it when there's no rain, checkup on it, and other post planting operations as we were taught in Agricultural Science. That is the process. 

When solider ants moves, they do that in order. Very orderly. They don't move to invade or destroy. But you know locusts? They swarms, invade and devastate crops and cause major agricultural damages. 

PO is not a movement. Maybe yet. It is a truth and reality some do not want to accept. His candidacy to run for President was birthed by those I explained earlier. 

It is an act of illusion and foolery to think the present day scheming will amount to anything reasonable; electoral victory or close. He hasn't put in the process. 

The pre 2015 media scenes mentioned was birthed by a lot of factors. First, that the person on the ballot was already a political movement. A huge one loved by his people who are the most populous in the country. A former military head of state. Someone who has contested elections thrice and was coming so close, kept pulling 12 million votes. Even when he had no boys scouts or foot soldiers at his side to aide those results of electoral outings. His winning in 2015 was as a result of that aged years of trying, efforts and process. Plus other factors that come into play. 

Peter Obi on the other hand isn't. Just like the reason why Buhari couldn't win in those previous elections with his movement and huge followership (which is very more large than PO today) is because of that absence of political structure to win a Nigeria political arena. This can be countered with sense of reason and logic. But he kept on with a process. 

In those years of Buhari electoral trials, he kept his movement firm, building human networks and drawing political inroads ahead. And he had many political allies, and he need to do is convince them to buy into his plans and visions. He didn't start or decide what he wanted to do months to election. It was years before. Years of planning. And yet, he still lost. Woefully. It is foolery, weak thinking or very light level of political assessment to now believe any magic would happen between today and national election. 

As we journey 2023, the social media users in Nigeria will continue to talk about Peter Obi, and that's not because he is close to winning, it's because some fractions (that are perceived to be large on SM are rooting for him, and they are not much, only that their presence is like locusts, they invade and sting). Or would anyone say Tinubu and Atiku don't have large social media presence, too? Fortunately, that's not the only things they have. They have wide offline presence, too. The way they talk about PO (his speech, dressing, where he goes and not go, who he met and not met, etc) that's how they'll talk about other candidates, too. It's part of the process and scheming. But does talking about on social media or trends on social media that have less than 20% of total numbers of Nigerians that'll vote decides who wins or not? Hell no. That's the truth and logic about it. Social media isn't as broad as this when Buhari, OBJ, Yar'adua were running for President, what were the parameters of measuring potential winners then? - Your foot soldiers, political networks, base, plus nationwide acceptability, the way and your capacity to swim around, money, etcetera etcetera. 

This is how the locusts and soldier ants come to play. Some political parties and aspirants and their supporters are already a movement, moving steadily for years, very focused and doing all they have to do to win. And they are desperate about it. Some are what they are, getting fooled and distracted by social media, stinging everyone that disagree with them, etc. 

The result will manifest after election. And then, if someone isn't illusionary, we already know the whys and factors to some winnings and losing. It's not ambiguous. But if it is cruise or mockery or some unintelligent contextual relevance one want to make to advance any point, haba, the political atmosphere loves that most. It's part of the game. 

And by the way, there are a lot of schemings, games, permutations ahead, it'll be exhausting to engage in some unnecessary subjects now. They'll unveil themselves naturally.

Olúségun Obásanjó's pounded yam

By Lasisi Olagunju 

(Published in the Nigerian Tribune on Monday, 22 August, 2022)

Olúségun Obásanjó's mother told him at the very beginning that if pounded yam is not much, it must be made hard and tough (iyán tí kò pò, ó gbodò yi). Read his biographies. Ashabi Obasanjo Bankole had only him and his sister, Adunni. Her hearth had enough embers, her mortar and pestle had diligence but her yam was small and she knew it. So, she did extra work in the making of her Olusegun's pounded yam. The result is the mouthful which Nigeria has had of the soldier since 1975 – or rather, since he journeyed into the army in 1958.

I am not sure if I meet Obasanjo tomorrow I will greet him. At least, if I can avoid him, I will. And that won't be because I was not trained to greet elders. I will avoid him because this elder I greeted twice in the past and twice I got the same response: He snubbed me – and you know what snub means: ignore, rebuff, repulse. Those are not nice words. On each of those occasions, what I felt was that the sun should not ignore a village because it is not a city. But I cannot ignore the General's moves and movements - because they potentially impact me; because I am a Nigerian. And so, I read him left to right; right to left. And I will be shocked if there are not other Nigerians - millions - who do what I do.

Something happened last week in Abeokuta. If you sell your relation for a kobo, you won't be able to buy him back for a billion naira. That is why it is said that the elderly are brisk with the ears and the eyes, never with the lips. At the June 2018 national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) where Adams Oshiomhole was elected chairman, Senator Bola Tinubu had some words for General Obasanjo. He said the former president was a homeless busybody who poked his nose into APC's affairs by asking Muhammadu Buhari not to seek a second term. “Thank God he (Obasanjo) is not a part of our party; this busybody. Unfortunately he has torn the card of his previous party so he has no home.” That is what Tinubu said. And it was not the only time the Asiwaju of Everybody, an aspiring president, poured odium on the former president. The group he leads has unruly dogs primed to snatch the walking stick from our elders. So, when I saw Tinubu in the home of 'homeless' Obasanjo last week, I saw irony in ways my literature teacher couldn't teach me. If the axe forgot, would the tree forget too? I was eager to know if the Balogun of Owu had a reply for the discourteous Balogun of Borgu. Obasanjo is an Owu man. We are told Owu has no sword for revenge but his tongue talks forever about wrongs done to him. But in vain we waited. Obasanjo did not respond to that past of insults.

There are really very few saints here. The General himself has a nagging past of immolation of his brothers to appease alien gods of Nigeria. In his very private moments, he should be contrite and seek forgiveness. 

Why do strong and not strong politicians go to strongmen for electoral support? How many votes do they command? Unless you are in politics you may not know. But will it help if you read Mario Puzo's The Godfather? You may also check Stan Lee's Kingpin. People like Obasanjo have special pots of hot water in which they dip unruly buttocks. There was a 19th century warrior in Yoruba land (Fabunmi) whose praise name includes one "who snatches a tree branch from the monkey's grip." That line fits Obasanjo, especially when you try to count how many monkeys he has had to grapple with in the last twelve years. And you remember this line in the poem, 'Elephant': One "who tears a man like a garment and hangs him up on a tree." Elephant has very thick skin; his eyes see far and his ears travel beyond the forest, his trumpet shrill as the final call. With his dense temporal lobe, the elephant never forgets. Because he is a moving mountain, ponderous Obasanjo is a perpetual 'man in the news.' He was in the news for most of last week – Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. There are videos of Obasanjo trending as I write. In one - with Charly Boy - he describes himself as "father of frustrated Nigerian youths." I know where he is coming from. Our ancestors said a “child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth.” Ask northern Nigeria. Today's terrorists were yesterday's leftovers. Obasanjo warned four years ago that we “should not reinforce failure.” We did and today Nigeria is homeless home and abroad. He warned repeatedly and was called names. He has also been very loud on those who would make the fighting force of tomorrow's Boko Haram. He said they are the almajirai of today.

On Friday, 23 September, 2011, I wrote a piece on Obasanjo, man of war and peace. It was to that piece I ran when the APC caravan entered Abeokuta last week. Some of the old lines I repeat here - and there. What I wrote eleven years ago was triggered by his daring march into the den of Boko Haram in Maiduguri in search of peace. The sore hadn't become cancerous that time. He sat down with the terrorists; they told him their problem with Nigeria; they told him what they would take. The man came back with a report - And what happened to his report? Ask Goodluck Jonathan.

In the Foreword to Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, A life of Service, the biography of his deputy as military Head of State, Obasanjo identifies what he defines as military war and political war. Political war, he holds, is much more challenging and dangerous than nuclear warheads and battle tanks. He thought he understood perfectly the meaning of war in both situations. But he must be taking new lessons now on how to get politicians to be committed to commitments. He held a meeting with those he called "brothers" last week. They begged him to keep it out of the news; he kept it out of the news; those who asked him to keep quiet addressed the press. If that was an ambush, it would appear the attackers picked on the wrong prey. On Saturday, Obasanjo poured water on infantile fires of the Èmi l'ókàn' people whom he accused of "claiming to be insiders" at his meeting with Tinubu and crediting to him statements he had not made. Silence when you should not be silent, he apparently remembered, begets misfortune.

A man trained in the cold-blooded art of war, Obasanjo swore to fight on land, sea and in the air in defence of the fatherland. He took the solemn military oath to die for the nation. But his life has not been about just dying for the nation, he has also perfected the art of living for Nigeria. His biographer, Onukaba Adinoyi Ojo, quoted the poet, Odia Ofeimun, as describing Obasanjo as “a small man striving always to rise higher” and though “not without warts”, he is simply “a dutiful human being… readier to shine than he is to be charitable to other stars.”

A man of destiny, it would appear that his lot had been to have others work hard enough for him to climb higher. He took over the command of the Third Marine Commando from his course mate, the “flamboyant and courageous” Black Scorpion, Brigadier Benjamin Adekunle, on May 12, 1969 and by 12th January, 1970, Biafra surrendered to him. Five years later, he did not know about the coup that ousted Yakubu Gowon but inscrutable fate made the coup plotters insist he joined Murtala Mohammed to run the new government. When Murtala Mohammed, the first Kano man to rule Nigeria, was killed in Col. B. S. Dimka’s abortive coup of February 13, 1976, Obasanjo inherited the throne. When Sani Abacha, the second ruler of Nigeria from Kano, died on the throne like the first, it was nature’s way of preparing the throne again for Olusegun Obasanjo.

In “military wars,” he always escaped the bullets, even having the other person take them on his behalf. Benjamin Adekunle told a story which Obasanjo denied: At the Regular Officers' Special Training School, Teshie, Ghana in 1958, there was a parade and Obasanjo moved the wrong leg. In the military, every wrong move has a punishment. There was for this particular one; the expatriate Company Sergeant Major (CSM) thought Adekunle was the culprit, coughed and ordered the Nigerian to open his mouth for his phlegm. "How does it taste?" What would the cadet say other than "Fine sir"? In the 1976 Dimka coup, a deadly version of the bullet-swap happened to then Colonel Mathew Ray Dumuje; he took the route Obasanjo was meant to take and the coupists thought he was Obasanjo; they shot him. In March 1961, he was in the Congo on United Nations Peacekeeping mission when Congolese soldiers abducted him. He was seconds away from execution when a counter, superior order came that Lieutenant Oba must not be killed. Some others were not that lucky. Five years later in January 1966, Obasanjo arrived in Nigeria the night of the first coup and was, in fact, housed by Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, one of the masterminds in Kaduna. And when his host’s coup failed and southern officers were mass-murdered, Hassan Katsina, who had emerged leader of northern region’s band of vengeful military officers, was quoted as saying “We must do everything to protect Obasanjo from harm. Nigeria will need him in future.”

A man not given to orthodoxy, at the height of the battle against apartheid in South Africa, Four-Star General Obasanjo publicly prescribed African juju as the weapon to chase away the white supremacist. And he fights his own wars (cowards use proxies); every day presents fresh opportunities to test his biceps, his ever-ready prowess. His tough, deliberate physique advertises him as an elephant ready to uproot any stubborn forest on its path. He does not mind stepping on toes if it is in pursuit and attainment of his goals. He has the mindset of a messiah, although he does not see the other person as a possible messiah. He is an enigma who does not care what the world says about him, and about his private and public actions.

Like Mark Twain's Henry VIII, Olusegun Obasanjo loves women. He loves money. He loves power. He covets and cuddles all these. He does not joke with anybody with any of these three prima indices of raw success. The old man updates himself like a sloughing, molting snake - growing, gathering and shaking off parasites. He loves knowledge for his person - e.g. getting a PhD at old age. And I think I read somewhere that twelve of his children have PhD. He enjoys showing off his native intelligence and deep understanding of the ways of man. He is the quintessential king, “in his bloom… a blossom”, coveting the good things of life and fighting his battles without giving anybody a chance. His critics say sometimes he repays good with the opposite of good. A man who was heaved out of jail and deposited onto power by the traditional kingmakers of Nigeria, Obasanjo waited till after the 1999 elections to announce to his backers that if they saw their moral and financial support for his aspiration as an investment, they were mistaken. “They just lost that investment,” he gleefully declared. Those financiers were soon to know the currency of truth spoken by a daredevil soldier.

Despite the hubris that drags his ponderous frame, however, even his most ardent critic would refrain from faulting his patriotic commitment to the Nigerian nation. How wise that is in the light of current structural realities, I do not know. But I know that in critical moments in the nation’s history, he always showed up to lead the pull-back from the precipice. His September 2011 expedition to bloody Jos and to terrorist Boko Haram in Maiduguri was a continuation of the story of one man whose history and that of Nigeria conjoin. Perhaps in his passion for Nigeria, warts and all, and for its continued peaceful existence, Obasanjo is just showing gratitude to God for making him the greatest beneficiary of the amalgamation of 1914.

The Yoruba content of the APC who routinely use elders as their chewing stick were in the old soldier's home last week in search of power. Political playboys are adroit at taking preys to bed -in repeated times. If Obasanjo was their navigator in 2015, why not in 2023? Last week, he received them warmly and held their hands; he wined and dined with them. He cracked jokes too: "Èmi l'ókàn; Eléyi; Ó lu'lè - I don't know if they are good words, but we will be using them." Obasanjo is an Owu man. Olowu was that king who went out at dawn with six subjects. He returned at dusk with one lonely one. What did he do with the remaining five? He fed them to the gods of vengeance. There is a tree in Yoruba forest called Ìrókò. You can abuse Ìrókò; you can even curse it. Ìrókò does not reply insults; it kills – but definitely not immediately.

8/26/22, 9:28 AM - +234 903 224 4825: If on Reliable Surz election day, we fix classes for students of English or any department, 200l or any level at all so that they'll come around and vote; are we not desperate? Is that not also desperacy? Some thoughts just running in my minds ni o.
8/26/22, 9:30 AM - +234 810 619 9957: We are not desperate we just don’t want to leave any room for lapses & ascertain our victory.
8/26/22, 9:30 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Or it's just that we're doing just what we have to do to win?
8/26/22, 9:31 AM - +234 903 645 3146: Definitely
8/26/22, 9:31 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Okay...

Why can't we bank on our campaign and that the sensitizations we've done prior that day is enough to make them come around vote?

I was an admin
8/26/22, 9:32 AM - +234 903 645 3146: Students like one motive to drive them to election ground and it goes beyond campaigning only
8/26/22, 9:33 AM - +234 810 619 9957: Sure we do bank on our campaign and others but after campaign there is room for canvassing and effective delivery of our Candidates or mandates by professionals who we call loyalists
8/26/22, 9:35 AM - +234 903 224 4825: Okay. That we believe our campaign and sensitizations aren't enough to make them come around (which in real sense should be enough), is it not desperate doing something else (asking them to come for a class that's not holding, we've told them a lie and rode in their intelligence or something) to make them show up still and VOTE as our original mindset of asking them to come?
8/26/22, 9:36 AM - +234 903 224 4825: It means our campaigns (which include sensitizations, who to vote for, how to vote, what to vote with, etc) isn't enough. We need to tell them another "lie" so that they can vote. Sheybe?
8/26/22, 9:37 AM - +234 903 645 3146: If we believe lecturers gat roles to play in elections,
Then this particular phase of having a class is the path

8/26/22, 9:40 AM - +234 903 645 3146: Take my department for example 

Dat particular lecturer will fix a class for all level at the same time,
Dem no born us well, we go show up

He go will us level by level to goan vote and he must see dat ink marker on her finger as signs pe we don vote

Dats why, o rare make the candidate wey we vote for lose election

It depends on the purpose i.e if it's a store of value, Gold is the best option.

If it's for a medium of exchange, Bitcoin is the best.
