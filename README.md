# INTRODUCTION
Intellectual Traditionist WhatsApp platform is a group that comprises all bonafide comrades who belong to a union group called Tradition in TASUED. Being a very busy platform, I decided to carry out an analysis to know how busy the platform can be, how users send messages, and message trends daily. The motive of the analysis is to find out the members who keep the platform busy and how busy the platform can be in a day or month.

# DATA SOURCE

The dataset used for this analysis was gotten from the chat exported from the Intellectual Traditionist WhatsApp platform. All media were excluded.

# DATA TRANSFORMATION

After the exportation of the chats, all the data were together in a column. I opened the data in Microsoft Excel and study the single column to know how the data will be regrouped. After understanding the datasetâ€™s arrangement, I imported the txt file into Power BI power query where I did all the wrangling.
I imported the single-column txt file into Power BI and cleaned it in the power query. I added 5 new columns from the original single column. I separated the Year, Time, User, and Message into these five columns.
Being a txt file, some messages spilled over to another row, because of this, new columns were added from the Year column, the columns are Day and Month. Because of the spilled messages, some rows in the Month column that does not contain number showed error, so these rows were removed, and the spilled message was also removed from other rows automatically.
The four months came in number (5,6,7,8), but they were replaced to text (May, June, July, and August) for comprehension.
To remove some unwanted data, all the columns were filtered. For example, in the username column, some data which include (someone who was added, someone who left, and the verification number of someone who has changed) were filtered out.
